We had a letter to the editor complaining about ballots for the local elections earlier this month.  Their complaint?  The paper ballot didn't identify the party the candidates belonged to.  This person claimed they had difficulty voting (supposedly holding up the line according to them) because they didn't know who the Republicans were, which is who they wanted to vote for.  

But people are fickle.  I've known people who go on about how Obama hates the troops and doesn't love them like Bush did.  So when Obama mentions no boots on the ground in regards to ISIS, thus keeping soldiers out of harms way, suddenly he is a pussy and doesn't take terrorism seriously.  But that's because he is a Muslim and supports groups like ISIS, what, with his gay-pushing agenda and all.</Comment><Comment author="cynoclast" date="1448097960.0" date_utc="1448069160.0" id="cx7jtfh" parent_id="t1_cx79zvt" type="reply">&gt; cognitive dissonance

doublethink*

CD is when it hurts and you're on the verge of changing your mind. Doublethink is peaceful coexistence of contradictory ideas.</Comment><Comment author="WTFisTweeting" date="1448102517.0" date_utc="1448073717.0" id="cx7lymn" parent_id="t1_cx7jtfh" type="reply">cognitive dissonance&#160;is themental stress&#160;or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, performs an action that is contradictory to one or more beliefs, ideas or values, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.</Comment><Comment author="Blackhawk23" date="1448100205.0" date_utc="1448071405.0" id="cx7kvo6" parent_id="t1_cx7jtfh" type="reply">Double think is a 1984 Orwellian word basically meaning cognitive dissonance.

Double think is believing that contradictory ideas aren't contradictory.</Comment><Comment author="BumbleBeeEnema" date="1448103759.0" date_utc="1448074959.0" id="cx7mjgj" parent_id="t1_cx7kvo6" type="reply">&gt; Orwellian word basically meaning cognitive dissonance.

Cognitive dissonance implies that you are holding two mutually exclusive ideas as true, and being uncomfortable about it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance

Doublethink is actually very similar, but also sort of the opposite, where you hold two contradictory ideas to be true and are totally comfortable with either the lack of recognition of, or the incoherence in your worldview:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink

Not the same thing. Doublethink is a conflicted mind unable to reach a state of Cognitive Dissonance. Cognitive Dissonance is a good thing, because it is often an internal recognition that one's views need to be re-evaluated. Often growth comes from cognitive dissonance. No growth is possible with Doublethink, because you have reached these ideas by Orwellian means and not through your own accord.</Comment><Comment author="BAXterBEDford" date="1448108112.0" date_utc="1448079312.0" id="cx7oh10" parent_id="t1_cx79zvt" type="reply">I kind of need a reality check of some sort.

But my question is: ***Is the GOP so wack-a-doodle that there really is no chance in hell that any of their frontrunners could win the general election?*** It just seems to me that this election is going to be a cakewalk for the dems because all the candidates for the GOP have to appeal to this crazy extreme of the Republican Party that there is no way the majority of the voting US populace would elect any of them.

The Democratic Party has been the populist party for 200 years. The Republican Party has always supported industry and, to an extent, the elite. It's just that during the civil war, the elite were on the right side of history because they wanted to preserve the Union, which as the war transformed, thankfully led to the end of slavery.

But since the progressive era, when the federal government finally began to pass legislation that actually improved the lives of the working poor, the Republican party gradually shifted rhetoric.

The GOP now try to paint themselves as the defenders of states' rights and personal liberty, because "bring back Laissez-faire capitalism" would lose every election.</Comment><Comment author="AgoraiosBum" date="1448087383.0" date_utc="1448058583.0" id="cx7eaxh" parent_id="t1_cx7898y" type="reply">Nothing.

That's the problem with these outsiders... It's one thing for an outsider to come into Congress, it's basically designed to deal with that. But the President is the chief executive of the United States. There are about 2.8 million federal civil servants and another 2.1-ish million active duty and reserve members of the military. An annual budget of $3.8 trillion. And someone with no experience with government nor a deep understanding of how it works has no business getting anything more than a pen with the Great Seal... much less the whole Oval Office for four (or more) years.

I don't think they are. I think that it currently doesn't serve the people as well as it can, and they want change. Today's society has too many unintended consequences for people 230+ years ago to have foreseen. I don't think that current needs for rational gun control has to be mutually exclusive to gun ownership. 

&gt; Our other rights are worthless if we don't have the means to protect them when challenged.

I completely agree. But in its current incarnation it's barely tenable. I don't think the government knowing who has what guns is really a problem. I did some digging for numbers once, and estimated that there are three guns in private hands for every one in *all four* branches of the military, *plus* the entire nation's totality of police.

I can't conceive of a scenario where a stupid database would ever give them the upper hand to do away with them.

The NRA claims approximately 5 million due-paying members. That is roughly 6-7% of all gun owners in the United States - or to put it another way, between 73 and 81 MILLION gun owners are not members. 

So no, they don't have a 'pretty good' database of gun owning Americans.

It's the national politicians that try to divide the issue.  Seriously, I live in Arizona and both Democrats and Republicans love our guns here equally.  Hell, even our very liberal ACLU chapter has adopted NRA type language in talking about American's civil liberties to own guns, in contrast to the national ACLU's terminology.

Whenever national Democrats decide to make gun control a campaign issue, our purple state goes Red that election.

&gt; Another reporter tried to land the question. Was Carson talking about adding American citizens to the database?

&gt;"American citizens?" he asked. "There already is a database."

&gt;"You're talking about a more complex database," said the reporter.

&gt;"No, I'm not talking about anything," said Carson.

&gt;"The database you're describing is already in place," said the reporter.

&gt;"And that's what I'm saying," said Carson.

Guy literally also said for you people foaming at the mouth to attack religion:

&gt; "Did you actually hear what I said?" asked Carson. "I said, a mosque where there is activity -- terrorist activity or activity encouraging insurgency -- should be treated differently. And I would say that about any kind of institution, quite frankly."

&gt;"So, a Christian church?" asked the reporter.

&gt;"If they were inciting against the government, and they were trying to create terrorists?" asked Carson. "Of course!"

Can't wait to see the headline "Carson says he would want to track the movements of Christian Churches!"

Or how database systems work for that matter. Even data warehouses need to be pulling that info from somewhere to a centralized point to be queried. And that data needs to be uniform across the *entire* system, or you have an elaborate cross-walk system to translate that incoming data. Then you have the problem of validating the data for correctness and timeliness. Then you need a system that can actually handle all that trillions of data points and run queries in an acceptable time. If people do think that's possible, look at the ACA Web portals that didn't work then realize that would be 1 superset of data that would be kept on an individual. The UN has been trying and failing spectacularly to do something similar with its hundreds of programs.</Comment><Comment author="LesserPolymerBeasts" date="1448105004.0" date_utc="1448076204.0" id="cx7n3ym" parent_id="t1_cx7gls8" type="reply">I guarantee that this is what Carson has in mind:

And I used to work in a law firm where I was finding lost clients/defendants. I can absolutely confirm that at my fingertips I have (if I have their SSN or three other pieces of identifying information):

Birthday, address, phone number, probable e-mail addresses, any liens out on them, what car they own, the driver's license on it, what company they work for, what kind of residence they're staying in and their affiliation to it, and depending on how deep I want to go, I can dig up their social media profiles. I also have access to their FICO and background credit information.

I can completely stalk a stranger if I want to. I usually just need their first and last name.

So the technology exists and the information is already largely compiled. </Comment><Comment author="Nick4753" date="1448107789.0" date_utc="1448078989.0" id="cx7oc2w" parent_id="t1_cx7nrob" type="reply">You have access to that because many private sources use social security numbers as a common key when storing demographic/financial/transaction data on the individual level, and there are private companies that will aggregate that data based on that key.

That doesn't exist on the government level really. For example, I have a job and a passport. The State Department knows that I have a passport but doesn't know what job I have and how much I get paid, and the IRS knows I have a job and what I get paid but likely doesn't know I have a passport.</Comment><Comment author="Janube" date="1448121540.0" date_utc="1448092740.0" id="cx7t6mh" parent_id="t1_cx7oc2w" type="reply">It doesn't exist in that there is not a government sanctioned program for it, but it definitely exists in that the government has access to the information if they want it.</Comment><Comment author="NicNoletree" date="1448111664.0" date_utc="1448082864.0" id="cx7pxfp" parent_id="t1_cx7oc2w" type="reply">This information is related in ways other than SSN.

While it is true that within one agency people may only look at that one agencies data,  do not assume that there are not services and techniques that cross agencies. 

I used to work IT for a law enforcement agency and I packaged data so it could be searched by others,  and the people who I provided the data for sold a service to my investigators to search many data sources (including my data). And that was 16+ years ago.

Is there a database of foreign visitors to the United States?  Yes there is.  Is there a database of American Citizens? Yes there is.  He wasn't saying there should be more, just that the idea of a "database" isn't something to be worried about.

He then went on to clearly respond that it's wrong to target people based on their religion.  To be honest, I think it's fucking insulting that people think you could fuck up a question so easy.  They're fucking baiting him all day.

All this does is make him look reasonable. If you dislike the guy you don't need to look far to find fucked up things.

&gt;"I don't know what Donald Trump said last night," Carson responded.

&gt;"He said he wanted to track Muslims," explained a reporter.

&gt;"Oh, okay -- that part I did hear," Carson said. "I hope that we have a database on everybody! If we don't have a database on every foreigner who comes into the country, we're being negligent. I want us to be able to know who they are; I want us to know where they came from; I want us to know where they're going and why they're here."

&gt;"That's already being done," interjected the reporter.

&gt;Carson replied, "If you want to add more things to that, we can talk about it, and what the rationale is."

&gt;Another reporter tried to land the question. Was Carson talking about adding American citizens to the database?

&gt;"American citizens?" he asked. "There already is a database."

&gt;"You're talking about a more complex database," said the reporter.

&gt;"No, I'm not talking about anything," said Carson.

&gt;"The database you're describing is already in place," said the reporter.

&gt;"And that's what I'm saying," said Carson.

Arguably, the employees of a factory are simultaneously the factory's product, since it is from their exploitation that the the rich owners get even richer. 

I work for a major corporation myself - and of course we have a CEO who *literally* makes over 100 times my salary, and that is a salary that it took 16+ years and a master's degree to attain.  We hear a lot of pretty words from our CEO - emails with big gloried talk riddled with power words that are supposed to make us all work harder.  

All of it is empty rhetoric and bullshit, and those of us in rank and file just sigh and ignore it.  We know the CEO does not represent us or have our interests in mind, no; instead, he is thinking only of his own big fat wallet as well as those he is immediately accountable towards - the shareholders.

I do not see how this is any different from a new Clinton presidency, or just about any other that we've had in the last several decades.  These corrupt politicians will just smile and send us pretty speeches filled with big gloried talk riddled with power words that are supposed to make us all work harder, all while holding themselves accountable to their own wallets and those of their 'corporate' shareholders.

How in heaven's name did we let this happen to our government?  We have all been asleep for the last fifty years, and we have not paid enough attention to how our own government runs itself, and now the wolves are managing the chicken coop.

The corruption and co-option of our government has become so deeply entrenched, we now accept as some form of "normal".  We simply accept that for some reason it requires billions of dollars in campaign funds for an election to take place.

We have allowed those who benefit from these funds to arrange legalities whereby the only actionable offense in accepting money is a recorded and witnessed "quid pro quo" agreement, which no politician worth spending a dollar on would be caught by.

I fear that because the system disallows the election of true representatives of the people, those awful times you mention are the most likely outcome.

&gt;Wrong enemy

&gt;When, to be blunt, idiots and/or liars claim that tech companies are 'refusing to work with police and the government', and that if only they'd stop being so 'antagonistic' towards the calls for breaking encryption a solution could be found that would allow the 'good guys' in, but keep the 'bad guys' out, they reveal that their 'enemy' is not the tech companies, but a much more troublesome foe:

&gt;Reality.

&gt;No amount of wishing, no laws or calls for 'co-operation' or threats of 'do it on your own or be forced to do it by law' will change the underlying fact, a fact that they are either dishonestly ignoring, or just too clueless to know: 

&gt;There is not, and never will be, such thing as secure broken encryption or 'good guys only' security vulnerabilities.

&gt;At this point there is absolutely no excuse for anyone in the government or police speaking on the matter not to have done enough research to know this, so I can only assume that they know full well that they are demanding the impossible, and yet continue to lie and claim that it is possible, if only those dastardly tech companies would try harder.

&gt;Those that claim that it's possible for a 'golden key' system to be created, that claim that it's possible to weaken security such that only certain individuals can take advantage of the glaring vulnerability are either fools or liars, and need to be called out on it either way.</Comment><Comment author="Funkula" date="1448094813.0" date_utc="1448066013.0" id="cx7i99z" parent_id="t1_cx74szl" type="reply">Ah, "back doors".

It's shitposting at it's finest. If you read her actually quote she's not calling for the end of privacy or a law to ban encryption without backdoor keys like the GOP has been calling for. I'm going to reverse the article's bolding so you can see the part that the author is ignoring in his shitpost title:

&gt;Another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. **On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit.** So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy. 

Very big difference than the GOP and their stance of "force government back doors into everything". She's saying something needs to be done, but she doesn't know what, and it's not back doors, hence the call for the private and public sectors to work together to figure it out.</Comment><Comment author="Killyourpets" date="1448074230.0" date_utc="1448045430.0" id="cx75zip" parent_id="t1_cx74gqd" type="reply">She's fence sitting to garner the most support from the most people.

What else could it be?

The only reason for the private sector to work with the public on encryption is to ensure there are back doors.  The private sector already has it figured out and as the processing power of all devices gets better and better encryption can be expanded more and more.

The only reason the government wants to be involved is to ensure they can bypass it.</Comment><Comment author="Arinly" date="1448073579.0" date_utc="1448044779.0" id="cx75k0a" parent_id="t1_cx75991" type="reply">If you computers are magic to her, she may be asking for a magic solution.</Comment><Comment author="Ironhorse86" date="1448073519.0" date_utc="1448044719.0" id="cx75ijl" parent_id="t1_cx74gqd" type="reply">&gt; but she doesn't know what, and it's not back doors,

I'll go with that and I agree.  It is good to keep in practice.  If Sanders loses the primaries, I am very likely to write him in.

Sure there are people that aren't going to like his social programs or economic plan.

But he doesn't flip flop, double speak, mislead, and he's consistent. So you can look at his past stances and what he fought for and it's usually pretty good.

A lot of people said they were too similar and that it really didn't make a difference who you voted for and another section of liberals voted for Ralph Nader.  If 1% of the people who voted for Nader voted for Gore in Florida, GWB would never have been president.  If GWB had never been president I can almost assure you we would never have gone to war with Iraq.  Iraq has cost us (not anyone else) over 5000 lives and $1.7T.

What will staying at home because Hill is a shitty candidate (but still less shitty than any of the Republican candidates).  First, you can almost guarantee the Supreme Court will stay very conservative for the next 30ish years - do you really want another Thomas or Scalia?  Obama care will be gone, it's a half-assed bill but it's still better than nothing.  All you under 26 and on your parents insurance would be out in the cold, pre-existing condition out and if you think rates are high now you ain't seen nothing yet.  Wars, who knows, it seems there isn't a war that the Republicans aren't in favor of sending troops to fight in.  SSI and other social safety net programs expect them to be cut if not eliminated.

If you are wealthy, expect your wealth to grow (although statistically everyone does better under a Democratic president) , so if you want to make more money vote for the Dem.

You would pay relatively more under their economic plans while saving less, all while decreasing the safety nets that could prevent you from serious harm. For those four or eight years, your ability to determine your future would diminish exponentially and likely cause you to work excessive hours well into your eighties just so that you could handle your retirement years. 

The long term opportunity cost of a Republican from this crop of candidates is so high that defaulting to Clinton after your current choice is the only viable option. 

That said, a similar statement can be made about why your current choice (Sanders in my case) should be the first option taken in the primaries over Clinton. </Comment><Comment author="tossme68" date="1448075298.0" date_utc="1448046498.0" id="cx76op5" parent_id="t1_cx762qu" type="reply">then make sure you and your friends show up to the primaries.

A first-past-the-post, single member district legislature combined with a winner-take-all electoral college for the executive doesn't respond to strong third parties. The green party could garner 30% of the vote in every county and every state in the country and have literally ZERO representation in our government, at any level.

 A vote for anyone other than a republican or democrat (in *almost* every case, and certainly in the context of this discussion) is, at best, a wasted vote, and worse, will *strengthen* whichever candidate is furthest from your personal views, ideologically.

After all, it's not a stretch to turn on reform-minded Americans and treat them as terrorists these days.  It's been done for years in the U.S., thanks to the Patriot Act abomination and [Reagan's reprehensible executive order 12333](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/a-twisted-history-how-a-reagan-era-executive-order-led-to-mass-spying/).

I've said it before and it bears repeating, Hillary is nowhere near being a political centrist.  She's proven her far right Conservative leaning yet again with this opposition to encryption.  After all, Republicans are the only fools dumb enough to shred the Constitution when it suits their self-interest and oppression of the American people.  Law enforcement has sufficient tools to track terrorists without having to spy on innocent Americans.  If they feel the need to wiretap someone, the country already has the means to do so...use a freakin' court order and prove the need.  By court order, I'm talking about real courts, not the secret courts that were cobbled togther to circumvent the system.</Comment><Comment author="nixonrichard" date="1448103745.0" date_utc="1448074945.0" id="cx7mj8h" parent_id="t1_cx7i2b4" type="reply">&gt; After all, Republicans are the only fools dumb enough to shred the Constitution when it suits their self-interest and oppression of the American people.

All this boils down to.... YOU CAN'T PREVENT ENCRYPTION. (period). What? are you going to undiscover math or change the laws of the universe?  Prime numbers exist and you can't do anything about it. Because they exist so does RSA et al. and you can't "add a backdoor or exception to it." A politician asking for a backdoor to encryption just demonstrates how woefully ignorant they are about all technology.

You can't add a backdoor to existing systems because anybody can just choose to not use that system. Instead, choosing to use a system they built they doesn't comply with your wishes. There is a lot of easy math/cryptographic systems out there that are simply unbreakable. The first off the top of my head is a simple one-time pad. You can't add a backdoor or exception so these. They're incredibly simple to use too. You can't force apps to have backdoors either because the bad/good actors will simple write their own apps.  Politicians are arrogant if they think bad guys are going to use what you ask them to.

And then when tech companies don't comply, send agents to bust down their doors and arrest some executives and start pulling the power cords out of server racks.

Faced with that, tech companies will cave, because it's a choice between operating on the government's terms or going out of business.

Then you force everyone (terrorists... and also billions of totally innocent people) to go through the hassle of setting up all the encryption themselves. Ban unapproved encryption from all the app stores, and they'll have to go digging hard to even find the software.

You can't stop encryption entirely, but you can make it so that only the most dedicated people will get access to it. And that will keep a lot of people from actually using it. Heck, people already don't even use strong encryption even when it's fairly easily available to them.

Of course, to do all this, you have to resort to some pretty draconian law enforcement tactics, so hopefully that won't be tolerated by the people once the panic dies down a bit.</Comment><Comment author="Cepheus" date="1448077460.0" date_utc="1448048660.0" id="cx783oy" parent_id="t1_cx76tyt" type="reply">Nothing new here. Remember the Clipper Chip. It would seem the way that they would try to implement a back door is to force all hardware manufactures to insert the back door chip and all other hardware is illegal. But, of course, this ignores the fact that people who intend to encrypt will do so. So, ultimately, it just ends up invading the privacy of everyone for nothing.

Privacy really matters when everything is so connected.

I'm a Sanders fan. Personally I'd be campaigning for Clinton, Trump is simply too much. But, at the same time, I know a lot of people, good Democrats that voted for Obama, just wouldn't bother to vote for Hillary Clinton. It's not that they prefer Trump, it's just that taking time out of their day to go vote for someone they dislike is something a lot of people won't do.

If Hillary wins I'm sure the nation would divide into two camps -- pro-Trump and anti-Trump. Remember 2004 and the two camps the country split into? Pro-Bush and anti-Bush. Or 2008, or 2012 -- pro-Obama and anti-Obama.

That's because Hillary's support is based entirely on appearance.

The more exposure she gets and the more people who read into what she says the more her support shrinks.

She is the most corruptly establishment candidate I think I have ever seen. Every single thing she does is guided by someone else. Nothing she does is her own thoughts or opinions on anything. The only thing that matters to her is towing the most politically expedient line.

If the race ends up as Trump v. Clinton I'm voting Trump.

There may be in politics, which one could argue is why we get ourselves in so many quagmires, but not in mathematics.

Due to how encryption is set up any purposeful "freebie" inserted into it essentially corrupts the whole product. Again as others mentioned think of it like : 1+1 = 2. What Hillary and other woefully ignorant and/or malicious politicians are suggesting is that we say "1+1 = 2, but sometimes let us make it =3". That doesn't work. It undoes the purpose of everything.

As our country, economy, and society gets more and more involved and integrated in the sciences, technology and mathematics there is a lot less room for "middle-grounds" which do not exist for the most part in the hard sciences. Decisions now are going to have a magnitude of which we haven't seen in a long time and will resonate for generations. 

The sad part is that people still fall for these emotional pleas and false choices. The population is being taken advantage of right in front of their eyes due to a lack of understanding (which, is completely understandable because there is A LOT that goes into these things). But holy hell as a non-affliated voter it is infuriating to see the blind conviction of "party people" on both sides not comprehending the fact they are both fucking themselves because they can't get over the show they've been made a part of. </Comment><Comment author="newdefinition" date="1448070253.0" date_utc="1448041453.0" id="cx73byc" parent_id="t1_cx7196m" type="reply">This is the kind of empty platitudes that work most of the time, saying  "we should work together to find a solution". But it's not the kind of thing that works with encryption. It's like if Microsoft and the NSA were both solving:

    X^2 = 20+X

And Microsoft said that X=5, but the NSA would prefer that X=4. You can't work together to come to a solution. Saying that X=4.5 or even 4.9 isn't better. There's no compromising with math.

And that's what lots of politicians have been suggesting, that there's a way to make "secure backdoors", and they're suggesting that because they don't understand the topic. It's just mathematically impossible. Hillary has joined the ranks of politicians that are asking for a value of 4 sufficiently large that it equals 5.</Comment><Comment author="CameronNemo" date="1448074052.0" date_utc="1448045252.0" id="cx75va1" parent_id="t1_cx7196m" type="reply">[Clinton is looking for a middle ground on encryption that experts say doesn&#8217;t exist.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/02/25/clinton-is-looking-for-a-middle-ground-on-encryption-that-experts-say-doesnt-exist/)

I don't know about that man. Ain't nothing easy about getting into the top 5.

First you've got the top 3, which most people agree on, as Washington, Lincoln, FDR, though as to even their order it's a bit of a toss up. But assuming those 3 are definitely in the top 5, which come on they have to be, that leaves 2 spots left.

So who do we have. Teddy, Jefferson, Wilson, and let's throw in a dark horse with Polk. Other arguments can be made for Truman, Jackson, LBJ, and I'll even accept a go at Kennedy and Madison or Adams (the first, JQA is a solid mid tier sure but can't compete in the bigs).

So from them who is he definitely better than? I'd give it to Teddy 9 times out of 10, so that leaves 1 spot left in the top 5, and frankly I'm going to err on the side of Jefferson. So maybe he gets past those two but for me he's out. 

For the rest: I'd probably go with Wilson, but I could be persuaded otherwise. I'd say better than Polk, but not a huge gap. Probably edges Truman, definitely edges Jackson what with the whole tiny little genocide he pulled, and definitely over Kennedy/LBJ, both of which I think had more flaws than we like to remember. I like Madison and Adams, but I think he beats them out.

So I'd say easy top 10, but top 5? No, I just can't make it work. And I love me some Eisenhower, I just think Teddy and Jefferson are more solid.</Comment><Comment author="misyo" date="1448106708.0" date_utc="1448077908.0" id="cx7nv2t" parent_id="t1_cx7k21q" type="reply">Why is Washington in the top 3?

due to isolationists in congress, probably the one thing that allowed ww1 to become world war 2 , since a united states involved in the league would have probably soften the terms on germany and would have actually shown structural integrity in such an ambitious organization

http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25838

&gt; America does not prosper unless all Americans prosper.Government must have a heart as well as a head. Courage in principle, cooperation in practice make freedom positive.

&gt; The record of performance of the Republican Administration on behalf of our working men and women goes still further. The Federal minimum wage has been raised for more than 2 million workers. Social Security has been extended to an additional 10 million workers and the benefits raised for 6 1/2 million. The protection of unemployment insurance has been brought to 4 million additional workers. There have been increased workmen's compensation benefits for longshoremen and harbor workers, increased retirement benefits for railroad employees, and wage increases and improved welfare and pension plans for federal employees.

&gt;In addition, the Eisenhower Administration has enforced more vigorously and effectively than ever before, the laws which protect the working standards of our people.

&gt; Workers have benefited by the progress which has been made in carrying out the programs and principles set forth in the 1952 Republican platform. All workers have gained and unions have grown in strength and responsibility, and have increased their membership by 2 millions.

So, let's see, Republicans were proud about the Eisenhower's Administration record increasing minimum wage, enlarging Social Security and increasing benefits; as well as increased union membership.

Let's continue. 

&gt; **The protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration.**

Wow, I don't even see Democrats today willing to say that. 


&gt; The Republican Party is determined to press all such actions that will help insure that every child has the educational opportunity to advance to his own greatest capacity.

&gt; We have fully resolved to continue our steady gains in man's unending struggle against disease and disability.

generic typical platitudes.

but wait...

&gt; We have supported the distribution of free vaccine to protect millions of children against dreaded polio.

Now we're talking. 

&gt; Republican leadership has enlarged Federal assistance for construction of hospitals, emphasizing low-cost care of chronic diseases and the special problems of older persons, and increased Federal aid for medical care of the needy.

&gt; We have asked the largest increase in research funds ever sought in one year to intensify attacks on cancer, mental illness, heart disease and other dread diseases.

Whoa, channeling Bernie Sanders?

Now what about government employees?  

&gt; We will vigorously promote, as we have in the past, a non-political career service under the merit system which will attract and retain able servants of the people. Many gains in this field, notably pay increases and a host of new benefits, have been achieved in their behalf in less than four years.

&gt; The Republican Party will continue to fight for eagerly desired new advances for Government employees, and realistic reappraisement and adjustment of benefits for our retired civil service personnel.

Does any of this sound like any national Republican today? 

&gt; We favor self-government, national suffrage and representation in the Congress of the United States for residents of the District of Columbia.

The national Republican party said this!

&gt; We recommend to Congress the submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for men and women.

they're on a roll.

And now another issue hot in the news today.... refugee immigration..... hold on let's see .... yup it's in there....

&gt; In that concept, this Republican Administration sponsored the Refugee Relief Act to provide **asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons**, and undertook in the face of Democrat opposition to correct the inequities in existing law and to bring our immigration policies in line with the dynamic needs of the country and principles of **equity and justice**.

They wanted to highlight their desire for Puerto Rican independence from US rule.

The nationalists, identified as Lolita Lebr&#243;n, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irving Flores Rodr&#237;guez, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and began shooting at the 240 Representatives of the 83rd Congress, who were debating an immigration bill. Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried and convicted in federal court, and given long sentences, effectively life imprisonment.

And members of congress from other parts of the country can overrule local laws, so only limited self-government as well.</Comment><Comment author="xnop1414" date="1448123484.0" date_utc="1448094684.0" id="cx7togl" parent_id="t1_cx7g4vl" type="reply">Thanks for a great post.

&gt;Our great President Dwight D. Eisenhower has counseled us further: "In all those things which deal with people, be liberal, be human. In all those things which deal with people's money, or their economy, or their form of government, be conservative."

Interestingly, Eisenhower spent $3 *trillion* (in today's dollars) on infrastructure which apparently was considered conservative.

&gt;We shall ever build anew, that our children and their children, without distinction because of race, creed or color, may know the blessings of our free land.

Yes, that says "without distinction".

&gt;We firmly believe in the right of peoples everywhere to determine their form of government, their leaders, their destiny, in peace.

To be fair, neither Republicans nor Democrats have really stuck with this one.

And finally,

&gt;America does not prosper unless all Americans prosper.

I heard this in the voice of Bernie Sanders.

Watergate and the Vietnam war had lessened the public's trust in government. There was also a gasoline shortage which infuriated people. Add in the Iranian hostage crisis which made the Democrats look weak and you had just the right recipe for Republicans like Reagan to discredit Keynesian Economics (which had worked well for forty years) and New Deal policies.

Christian Republican voters usually fall into two groups:

1 - hardliners who have hatred gays, poor people, etc... and want to make Christianity the official religion

2 - non-crazy Christians who think the GOP is really focused on doing good things but they're too damn stupid to realize it's a sham and they're being duped by wealthy people with religion as a tool.</Comment><Comment author="Gracchi2016" date="1448123040.0" date_utc="1448094240.0" id="cx7tkfx" parent_id="t1_cx7ske3" type="reply">You're missing a big category: single-issue pro-lifers convinced abortion is a holocaust.</Comment><Comment author="flameruler94" date="1448128655.0" date_utc="1448099855.0" id="cx7uv04" parent_id="t1_cx7tkfx" type="reply">Mostly falls into the first category, honestly</Comment><Comment author="bluefootedpig" date="1448104916.0" date_utc="1448076116.0" id="cx7n2l6" parent_id="t1_cx7kwcj" type="reply">&gt; because the party could not run an election

Not entirely true. It was when Pat Robinson (a christian who owns a "news" network, the 500 club) said that Christians were the "silent majority" and that if they voted according to their belief, we could have a godly nation. He ran as a republican. 

Before that, Christians were actually fairly well split between the two parties. </Comment><Comment author="sbetschi12" date="1448128014.0" date_utc="1448099214.0" id="cx7uq5d" parent_id="t1_cx7n2l6" type="reply">Isn't it the 700 club?

"Folks who do not like guns [are] fine. But we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country &#8212; 99.9 percent of those people obey the law.

Sanders is the only one that actually understands the implications of both sides of the argument for and against gun regulation. There needs to be an understanding wherein gun owners understand that something should be done to stop us from having a new massacre every week; there also needs to be an understanding from liberals that gun are an integral part of many people's culture and feelings of self-security.

I grew up in a rural town where every kid got a .22 or a 20 gauge shotgun for their 10th birthday, guns were a part of life and weren't that big of a deal.  My wife on the other hand is from NYC and a gun in her opinion has a single use, to shoot people.  Now that I'm older I live in the city and I really see both sides of the argument.  I think Bernie is in the same boat, being from Vermont guns are very common.  I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a rifle in his closet (that hasn't been shot in years).  But working in Washington he sees the issues with gun violence.  Not every gun owner is in the NRA and not every gun owner agrees with the NRA.  I think there is an area where gun owners/ civil libertarians and gun control advocates can agree, I think Bernie has the ability to advocate for both sides of the issue and this would allow some legislation to move forward.</Comment><Comment author="tsxboy" date="1448114457.0" date_utc="1448085657.0" id="cx7r09j" parent_id="t1_cx7qt40" type="reply">A voice of reason.. am I dreaming right now? </Comment><Comment author="The_Juggler17" date="1448126029.0" date_utc="1448097229.0" id="cx7ua92" parent_id="t1_cx7piqg" type="reply">Sanders is way more permissive regarding gun laws than people think.

In theory, capitalism is a great system that respects the freedoms of those under its rule, however there is one major flaw with it.  It is the same flaw that exists for democracy.  Both rely on humans to be inherently good.  Meaning, that the decisions made by humans under these systems would be 1)made with no interest in leverage over your fellow man, 2)made with the common good in mind.


     Unfortunately, we are all well aware that humans do not operate like that across the board.  Yes, there are people that think like that, however in a capitalist democracy, those people settle to the bottom, while those that are greedy, selfish, and feel entitled, rise to the top.  Those are not the type of people that should lead.  We have seen the outcome of such types of people many times through history.  They become tyrants, robber barons, CEO's.  The top 1%, or further, the top .01% did not get to that level by looking out for their fellow man, or by being fair.  They leveraged every possible way they could to get ahead of their fellow man. 



     I'm not sure when that way of thinking became the norm, or why it is engrained in business in general, but it is absolutely killing America.  Greed will be capitalism's downfall.  Like so many other systems of government, when the greedy and corrupt are allowed to flourish with no checks on them (I.e. Regulations, and other "bad" words") the general population suffers.  When that happens, production falls, families start worrying more about how to make ends meet, rather then doing their best at the job(s) they have.  It all starts falling apart.  It won't be until riots start, and the masses, whom have held the top %ers so high with their blood and sweat, decide that they have had enough, that we will really see these peoples true colors.  



     It is a sad thing to think about, but unfortunately true.

So I think you could do quite a bit just playing with the taxes of the top 1%, who have a lot of wealth and income these days. Not everything, but I doubt he is wanting to do everything with taxing the rich - single payer for example would likely just be a switch for everyone to paying more Medicare taxes in lieu of insurance premiums.

You can also spend money in key sectors to improve economic activity. Education and job training, healthcare, etc.  

Long term we need to manage our debt, but we also need to recognize that we can run in the red if long term that red is going to result in more growth. Short term deficits are ok, as long as the money is being invested wisely.

You think everyone's going to the beach on rich people's  $?

If you want specifics here we go:

Tuition free public universities.  First it's important to understand that tuition only makes up on average 1/2 of state universities budgets.  The rest comes out of state budget, sports and research grants (given by NGOs, Private corporations and government research organization).  Okay now, a .5% tax (1/2 of 1 percent that is) would more than pay for this.   Germany, Australia and many other countries already have this tax.   It would kill the high frequency trading industry in the US, but that's a parasitic industry.  Basically with high speed computers they prediction stock going up, buy them and sell them in fractions of seconds.  They are actually like a .5% tax on trading you're paying for stocks right now since they inflate the price.  

Second: Universal Healthcare.  You're taxes will go up probably about 9%.  Now, unless you're making more than 118k, that will be much cheaper than health insurance premium that comes out of your paycheck.  Now, if you have kids,  you're saving money until you make like 240k, since you pay the same taxes and your kids are covered whereas private companies charge you to put family members on.

On to infastructure.  You can pay for this entirely by closing corporate tax loopholes  in theory.   Of course companies will resist, find other loopholes.  You could do a 5 cent raise on the gas tax which hasn't been adjusted for inflation since the 70s.  These two things would cover a trillion  $ for infastructure over 10 years.  No sweat.

Expanding Social Security.  Okay so Social Security tax caps at 118k.  If you make 10 million you pay the same into SS as someone who makes 118k.  So you just raise that cap (IMO raise the retirement age as well) and you can make expand SS.

So that's how you pay for it.

Well, he hasn't specified all the details of his tax plan yet, but we can do some estimation based on available information.The WSJ claims the total price tag of his proposals is about $18 trillion over 10 years, $15 trillion of which comes from his medicare for all proposal. According to the economist whose work they cited for that number, that $15 trillion is a $5 trillion *savings* over the status quo. It would require raising taxes on most American households, but by *less* than they would otherwise spend on healthcare.

That leaves $3 trillion over 10 years, or about $300 billion/year. His proposal for free tuition at public colleges is to be funded by his financial transaction tax, which would account for about $70 billion per year of that $300 billion, leaving about $230 billion per year. Google tells me that the US federal government brought in some $3.42 trillion in revenue in FY 2015, and that about $1.5 trillion of this came from individual income tax receipts. Around 40% of federal income tax is paid by the top 1%, representing about 20% of their cash income (with their total tax burden including local, state, and federal taxes being around 31%). That means that raising their effective federal income tax rates by about half would bring in around $300 billion/year, more than covering the balance.

That hardly seems impossible to afford.</Comment><Comment author="Anon17666" date="1448117387.0" date_utc="1448088587.0" id="cx7rzwc" parent_id="t3_3tlwb7" type="comment">&gt;&gt;Sanders'

Forcing them to be citizens is hardly alienating them. When the spenders thrive, the economy thrives. Part of this is free college tuition.

Today's college education is yesteryear's high school diploma. Free public education was decried as socialist, and now, if you even threaten to defund it, you'll be crucified. It's become stringent to American life.

Too many of the polls are done by Clinton's Super PACs. They are trying to pretend everything's alright since they're currently in control. But that doesn't translate to the ballots, no matter how much propaganda they feed you about how your vote doesn't matter.

The fact is that very few people ever vote in the primaries, many fewer than who vote in the general election. And you see how good the establishment Democrats are at getting people to vote. People are liberal and they don't want this center-right party. The Democrats were terrible across the board in 2014, and that translated into Hillary Clinton.

The problem is the establishment wants to make everything quantitative because they think in numbers and money, not in people. Bernie Sanders is a humanist and he's showing us how politics should be qualitative and about human experience, and so instead of a fact like "Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State, so she has the clear advantage at foreign policy" making sense to you, you think about what she did while she was Secretary of State, to judge her experience qualitatively. She was behind Libya and the weapons program to arm rebels, in Libya and Syria. Her terrible foreign policy, which was done in favor of Saudi Arabia, who I might add donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, was to aid the Saudis in their eternal conflict with Iran. To side with the Sunni in their war with the Shi'a.

What the hell did she make us do? This is so much worse than what George W Bush did. We created a war zone in Syria so we could help the rebels overthrow Assad. When ISIS started killing American the public had more interest in the conflict in Syria, which we were already involved in, so that allowed congress to give billions and billions more dollars to this fiasco. This ended up with that $500 million program to arm and train 500 rebels. I guarantee none of them are left now. What the hell cost that much money?

The real issue is the leadership of our military. We need to force a lot of our leadership to retire and promote pacifists into leadership positions. And Hillary Clinton is by far a worst foreign policy strategist than Dick Cheney.</Comment><Comment author="throwaway5272" date="1448140934.0" date_utc="1448112134.0" id="cx7xov5" parent_id="t1_cx7w46y" type="reply">&gt;Too many of the polls are done by Clinton's Super PACs.

If you really do support Bernie Sander's run for president you need to understand how those on the fence or more right will react to this argument.   The Hillary loyalists will no doubt tell you that you are full of it and it's just another attempt to sully Hillary's good name. But to those on the fence voters that Bernie needs to win over if he will stand a real chance for the nomination, the "news" who are constantly helping Hillary + the Hillary camp's fake outrage at an accusation of corruption + a story that without enough evidence to convince people may sway them into believing in the establishment narrative that Bernie is never going to happen because he's too crazy or far left. 

Don't get me wrong, I encourage everyone to get involved in government and to debate their ideas, I just want you as a fellow supporter of Bernie Sanders to debate smartly and be ready for those questions.  </Comment><Comment author="Tasty_Yams" date="1448146736.0" date_utc="1448117936.0" id="cx7zr13" parent_id="t1_cx7tqax" type="reply">Look at what's happening on the Republican side:

The "establishment" hates Trump, thinks he will lose the general, and are doing everything in their power to stop him --- and yet he continues to dominate the primary.


If Bernie were really "the candidate that the majority of Democrats wanted" -- there would be something similar happening in the Democratic Party.

The scheduling of   debates, or amount of applause, or whatever -- wouldn't be able to stop it.</Comment><Comment author="somethingratherother" date="1448097074.0" date_utc="1448068274.0" id="cx7jdpq" parent_id="t1_cx7jbg4" type="reply">&gt; You are here framing this as a conspiracy theory.

It's also kind of pointless, at least today, since it no longer has the effect it used to. Before, a person's brain would simply turn off when they hear the word. 

Edit: Also, I'd like to point out that you guys are trying to associate this claim - that a debate was rigged in favor of a candidate - with outlandish and insane accusations by using "conspiracy," rather than corruption. If you think a rigged debate is in the same ballpark as reptilians and chemtrails, I don't know what to say. That *is* why you're using the word, correct? It's a very easy way to protect against any claims that corruption has occurred, when corruption is a very common phenomena. </Comment><Comment author="Emperor_Mao" date="1448109115.0" date_utc="1448080315.0" id="cx7ovvn" parent_id="t1_cx7jiw0" type="reply">The **theory** is that organizers within the DNC are **conspiring** to push Hillary through as the democratic candidate, unfairly. 

I get why you care about the semantics of the words used. I guess terming it a corruption allegation makes it less easily dismissed when contrasted with the term conspiracy theory. But really, Clinton supporters aren't going to listen either way, and those that are against Clinton are going to believe it.

* By the time this second debate happened the 2008 election cycle had already seen 27 democratic debates (a little outrageous, but it shows that they are stifling debates)

* The only candidate that benefits from less debates is Hilary Clinton

Debbie Wasserman Schultz is setting up the 2016 election cycle to funnel all attention possible to Hilary. She along with the rest of the DNC do not want a split in the party, they want to throw their money at one candidate and they want everybody on board with that one candidate. This election cycle reeks of exclusion and foul play to get what they ultimately want, a Hilary nomination. 

Larry Lessig raised more money than Lincoln Chafee before the first debate and was still excluded. Even if he didn't have a fully fleshed out campaign and was a single issue candidate he deserved to be on that stage more than that awkward dude who did nothing but make the other candidates look better by comparison.

These are just things I've observed while paying attention to this cycle. There are more shady stories and facts about what the DNC is doing to keep the nomination process tight and controlled.</Comment><Comment author="Saiing" date="1448138347.0" date_utc="1448109547.0" id="cx7wy7p" parent_id="t1_cx7wm0y" type="reply">&gt; By the time this second debate happened the 2008 election cycle had already seen 27 democratic debates (a little outrageous, but it shows that they are stifling debates)

Just like Bernie used the 'rural Vermont' card to cover up his gun vote. 

It only looks so monumental to you because of your bias for Bernie.</Comment><Comment author="some_a_hole" date="1448121634.0" date_utc="1448092834.0" id="cx7t7j2" parent_id="t1_cx7suv2" type="reply">What do you mean?  Unlike Hillary and Wall Street, Sanders isn't in the pockets of the gun lobby.  The NRA actually gives him a D-.  

Are you talking about the Brady Bill?  Sanders began the campaign saying how holding gun manufacturers accountable for killings with guns doesn't make sense.  I'm for Australian-level gun control, and I agree with him here.  

Are you talking about rural vs urban America Sanders brought up?  Hillary in 2007 also said there is a difference in rural and urban America in relation to gun culture.  Obama said the same.  
 
The nuance on this issue is that there are gun store owners selling to known criminals.  There has to be.  Something like 5% of gun stores provide almost all guns that are used in crimes.  These are the people who we need to go after.  Sanders has said this is true, and has tailored his message to say that "the Brady Bill doesn't go far enough," which shows a strong stance on gun control.  </Comment><Comment author="Anti_Bullshit" date="1448122815.0" date_utc="1448094015.0" id="cx7tiia" parent_id="t1_cx7t7j2" type="reply">&gt; What do you mean?  

He voted against the Brady bill because he comes from a 'rural state'. That was a pathetic excuse just like Hillary's and anyone who is neutral will rate them both as gaffes.

I just learned he also voted against it because of its federal mandate on waiting periods.  He thinks waiting periods should be a state-issue.  I don't agree with him there, but to compare that to Hillary hiding behind 9/11 to cover up her campaign finance network is not an honest comparison at all.  

The media, I'm guessing from your reaction, over-played Sander's stance or misrepresented him.  Look:  

Sanders has voted for banning high-capacity magazines, voted for univeral background checks, for banning assault weapons.  Voted against allowing concealed carry across states lines.  

He's pretty damn liberal on gun control.  And tbh I think he can move America forward on getting some sane gun control.  The Brady Bill's part about holding gun manufacturers accountable for crimes was just ridiculous to include.  </Comment><Comment author="Anti_Bullshit" date="1448124754.0" date_utc="1448095954.0" id="cx7tzq3" parent_id="t1_cx7trqp" type="reply">&gt; I explained why he voted against it before,

More than likely they'll continue doing what they've been doing - staying at home being irrelevant, especially if their participation in the process hinges on Sanders being present. </Comment><Comment author="Ephem-eric" date="1448141918.0" date_utc="1448113118.0" id="cx7xzzn" parent_id="t1_cx7shpr" type="reply">I've encountered Bernie supporters here in Colorado who don't even know we're a caucus state.</Comment><Comment author="ZombieVirus707" date="1448112053.0" date_utc="1448083253.0" id="cx7q2x2" parent_id="t1_cx7ksdc" type="reply">Well, good thing Hillary is still leading by 15-20% amongst real life supporters then huh?</Comment><Comment author="MorrowPlotting" date="1448103890.0" date_utc="1448075090.0" id="cx7mlnq" parent_id="t1_cx7ksdc" type="reply">Ha!

Bernie and O'Malley should be raising hell about this, calling her out and dropping this "Oh the Democrats are so intellectual and have smart debates!" bullshit. Fuck off with that, it's a losing mentality.

The GOP is smart -- they know they have a lot of candidates and they need to cull the herd. They also have celebrity candidates and odd outsiders who, at the very least, are bringing attention to the party (bad press is good press?) and whoever emerges will have run a marathon of debating and be in good shape for the big run.  

People don't want to admit it, but the conservative base is motivated and ready to go. The liberals aren't inspired by Hillary, but could be if Bernie or O'Malley would take the ball and run -- if only the DNC wanted that. </Comment><Comment author="cityofkern" date="1448149538.0" date_utc="1448120738.0" id="cx80zia" parent_id="t1_cx7znod" type="reply">&gt; The GOP is smart

Yeah, McCain isn't evil. And just because he's been wrong on many things before doesn't mean we can't give him credit when he says something right (like this topic). But that he's saying something right also doesn't change when he was wrong in the past.

Edit: And just because he's saying something right about this topic right now (don't discriminate children based on religion) doesn't change that he's *also* saying something wrong right now (that we should pause the refugee program).

Those groups aren't committing terror acts in the volume or on the scale that Muslims are. 

&gt;Do you associate the broader Christian movement with these extremists?

Yes I do, but only loosely since most Christians or Christian countries are not harboring or condoning those types of activities.

What is the volume and scale that makes one religion a cult and the other not? Who gets to determine this?

&gt;Whereas a large chunk of the Muslim world thinks the Charlie Hebdo attacks were justified.

Do you have a source or an explanation of a "large chunk"? I see a poll of British Muslims where 27% said they "have some sympathy for the motives behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks." That is higher than I would like, but "some sympathy for motives" is different than justified.</Comment><Comment author="Halomir" date="1448088692.0" date_utc="1448059892.0" id="cx7f1rg" parent_id="t1_cx7a0q0" type="reply">Yo mang! I think your math is off on this, especially since you're missing some broader historical examples of Christians being proper cock-bags.

I think the broader point my other redditors are trying to make is that there is a general belief that not ALL Muslims are associated or complicit in the types of violet actions that we've seen in the past few decades. 

I would say within a recent historical context is that we're dealing with the long term sociology-economic issues and conflicts that we have created or agitated in the Middle East region. 

If you're curious why Islam seems to be the defining factor, it has more to do with imagery and branding than anything else. Take the below thought process for example:

You're a disaffected individual that perceives the US and a coalition of western nations (US &amp; UK) protecting their financial interests in your country at the expense of the local population. You're pissed and for good reason and you want revenge (you'll call it justice because you felt attacked) so you find the one thing that will unite people and bring them to your cause. You can't educated people on a broad scale to understand the history of the situation and why they should fight but everyone you know goes to Church, so let's connect the too. 

Basically you have a group that is tying their politics to a religion, which historically has been fraught with issues including ISIS, Islamic Revolution in Iran, The Troubles, The Spanish Inquisition, The Crusades (all of them, even The Last Crusade). This is one of the reasoning the founding fathers of the United States elected for a separation between Church and State, thereby we should have a secular government. 

So to sum up my point here. We need to stop thinking of the US as some sort of Christian founded nation, founded by Christians, sure but saying we are a "Christian Nation" is just like Daesh claiming to be "The Islamic State." If we continue along this path, Daesh predictions will come true, we would have Holy War on our hands and with multiple nuclear super powers (some with itchy trigger fingers and launch codes) it may very well be the apocalyptic war Daesh keeps talking about.

People are afraid to use their healthcare because they cannot afford to go. 

Catastrophic coverage. If you break your arm, you won't go bankrupt. That's the point. 

And I'm calling it right now, the 9% is low. There are no free lunches people. If you *aren't* afraid to go to the doctor, costs rise. You'll end up paying more in taxes than you do now for your insurance AND deductible. Vermont or Colorado aren't the same as the whole US, where you have Southern states with people who still aren't insured and are going to cost big money once they are.  

I'm not saying it isn't a shitty situation, but pretending that Single Payer is going to somehow make everything cheaper is a lie. The government will have administrative costs just like private healthcare does. And the US isn't some European country. I've recently seen the 'other countries spend less and get better results' argument reborn -- didn't we put that to bed years ago when we realized the US is culturally different from those countries. 

Heck, I support Single Payer but it is gonna cost taxpayers $$$ and that could really hurt some people and the economy as well. And as for the evil insurance companies? Check this out:

Of course not (well, within reason). But it is a fact that costs will rise if you go more. 

One reason the ACA has seen cost over-runs? These people who were newly insured (especially in the poorest segment of society) needed more care than anyone thought (or at least projected on paper).

The 9% is almost certainly low. And of course, if the cheapest healthcare available to you costs more than 8%, you're exempt from the mandate to buy insurance.

There will be additional jobs created in the actual health industry from more people affording to go to the doctors, but it will not be immediate and it will probably take a long time to see it.  There may be money to grab a new hire in random businesses if they want, but that also would be hard to measure.  Eventually the market would work itself out.

It includes both income and payroll tax increases. In theory the payroll tax portion is on the employer, but there is nothing preventing the employer from collecting it from their employees (this is how Medicare and Social Security collections work).

If that is the way it goes, I am worried that in the transition corporate employers will use the confusion to shake off the perceived obligation for them to cover part of your insurance costs which is really only done to ensure competition. If that happens, the effective cost would go up for many with office jobs who still fall into the middle class.

That said, a fixed tax rate like that is a better deal the lower your income is (eventually the amount you're contributing is less than you would pay for insurance, and if you're unemployed your coverage is free of charge), so it is a progressive policy. I'm fine with that, and if I have to pay more so be it, I just don't want to be doing so solely to the benefit of my employer who is now free to not subsidize insurance costs like they had been.</Comment><Comment author="Moms--Spaghetti" date="1448119225.0" date_utc="1448090425.0" id="cx7sjum" parent_id="t1_cx7rsrh" type="reply">People are stupid, if you don't call it free they'll vote it down because they don't want higher taxes.

You can see (and read) tons of better reports on the history of why costs have artificially ballooned (several orders of magnitude beyond that of the rate of inflation), but here's a quicky video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrd72UtczMg

My point?

Government intervention isn't always the solution. In many, many, many cases government intervention causes unintended consequences. Like when the government mandated that home lenders had to loosen lending criteria to abide by new Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines . . . leading to homeless people getting home loans, and people with no valid ID or collateral. The result? Because of government manipulation in the industry, millions of people who couldn't actually afford to pay their mortgages were given loans, which led to historic levels of foreclosures. These toxic assets led directly to the 2008 housing bubble [and ensuing banking meltdown which threatened the global banking grid].

In other words, new government intrusion into the market didn't help things; it caused a crisis and a meltdown.

It *feels* good not to "discriminate" against people with no collateral and no valid ID; it feels emotionally satisfying to extend credit and loans to people with horrible credit scores . . . but the result was foreclosures and a crashing economy.

You can't run things according to "the feels".

Sometimes you have to use The Thinks.

And most politics is driven by "the feels". It's the art of manipulating people according to emotional responses. Of not addressing their intellects, but pandering to their impulses.

Very few people want to discuss the economy in grown-up terms. They don't want to discuss adult solutions or hear about "living within our means". They want freebies and promises of goodies with no consequences. And political demagogues ride to power on a wave of magical thinking.</Comment><Comment author="BernieBro" date="1448147125.0" date_utc="1448118325.0" id="cx7zwtn" parent_id="t1_cx7stfm" type="reply">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/07/college-tuition-is-getting-more-expensive-heres-whos-actually-to-blame/</Comment><Comment author="c0xb0x" date="1448146251.0" date_utc="1448117451.0" id="cx7zjye" parent_id="t1_cx7stfm" type="reply">The problem though is that you will always have a large amount of government intervention in the health care sector in the form of guarantees and regulations (unless you want to go for a dystopia where the poor have no guarantees of any sort of treatment).

So we compare the two systems: the American system costs 18% of the GDP to maintain, the rest-of-the-world system costs between 9-11% of the GDP of any country it's implemented in.

That said, while he only attracts a minority of democratic voters, he is popular with the American left. But he hasn't been debated against by conservative candidates that will want to draw democratic blood. FDRs other legacy was that his WPA was a giant patronage army that engendered support for the Dems. Republicans still have not forgotten that. If Sanders wants to try to invoke FDR, he will run into a generation of voters who have lived in the most prosperous period in human history. Say what you will, but the economy has exploded in size since the 1970s. Growth may have been faster in the 50-60s, but the marginal gain of government dollars spent has dramatically fallen. Diminishing returns have taken hold. There isn't another Hoover dam type project that is justifiable economically. Also America is the product of the enlightenment, which wholeheartedly embraced capitalism. Read what Voltaire said of the Royal Exchange in London, and you'll see that enlightenment values are better reflected in modern libertarianism than anything else. Socialism isn't American, in fact the term "American Exceptionalism" originally referred to American workers rejecting socialism. So no, it's not American. There isn't even anything American about it. Henry David Thoreau put it best when he said "That government is best which governs least". Socialism is wholly at odds with that sentiment. As succinctly put by Tocqueville "Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word, equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude."</Comment><Comment author="eyeheartsatin" date="1448087008.0" date_utc="1448058208.0" id="cx7e330" parent_id="t1_cx7bett" type="reply"> Can you please explain how socialism equals servitude?</Comment><Comment author="Gamecocks91" date="1448087442.0" date_utc="1448058642.0" id="cx7ec6y" parent_id="t1_cx7e330" type="reply">You become but simply a slave to the state without self agency.

Also you seem to be confusing classical socialism with Bernie's social democracy, which is merely a strong welfare state to act as a safety net to the harshness of the free capitalist market.

Furthermore, try lbeing free while living in poverty. Freedom doesn't exist when all you can do is struggle to survive. The economic "ladder", which is undoubtedly American value, has been destroyed by capitalism gone awry. Social democracy is the answer to that, and has been very effective in the countries where it has been implemented, perhaps the most successful form of government ever made

It was the first time I've heard him straight up pander and I trust him less now.

The whole point was to argue that he's not out of step with the Democrats and he's just a little more liberal. Then why does he need his special label for it? If he's not out of step, then why run as a Democrat in 06 and throw the party away once he won the primary? He's trying to argue that he's no different than other Democrats, but he's only part of the party when it's convenient to win a race. It was just pandering completely out of step with his actual history to try to pretend he isn't just running as a Democrat for convenience.

Why does he have to cling to his label if his argument is that he's not different? It just seems like he wants to lie about what he's really for. Don't tell me you're the same as the Democrats when your history proves otherwise.

I wanted him to show why he needs to define himself differently. Instead it felt like he wanted to run away just enough to call himself a mainstream Democrat.

And then that awkward foreign policy pivot. It was painfully obvious he's never played with foreign policy.

No, that speech is the first time I've seen him say things that didn't feel honest.</Comment><Comment author="sbfgts" date="1448085694.0" date_utc="1448056894.0" id="cx7dbdr" parent_id="t1_cx71jz1" type="reply">You didn't hear him pander before? </Comment><Comment author="Yourgotoman" date="1448069013.0" date_utc="1448040213.0" id="cx72isn" parent_id="t1_cx71jz1" type="reply">If bernie tried to pull away from the word he'd still get attacked by it; he's trying to assure people the word shouldn't be something toxic </Comment><Comment author="jckgat" date="1448069558.0" date_utc="1448040758.0" id="cx72vij" parent_id="t1_cx72isn" type="reply">He did try to pull away from it.

His whole argument for voting for him is how different he is, and this was supposed to be the speech that explains why he is.

Instead I got why he's the same. If he's going to argue he's really been a Democrat all along, then I want a good reason why he only picks up that label to win races. 

No, I think we got a song and dance to try to pretend he's always been a mainstream candidate to appeal to everyone. It was just pandering. I feel like he threw away his campaign.

He's trying to pretend he's an outsider and an insider now. </Comment><Comment author="Yourgotoman" date="1448070022.0" date_utc="1448041222.0" id="cx736il" parent_id="t1_cx72vij" type="reply">Most his policies are supported by the majority of Americans; his ideas are not outsider ideas.

And no I don't think he is consistent when he changes his party affiliation to win races. 

He's only coming across as a flip-flopper because he's making himself one. It's a positive campaign, except when he goes after Clinton. He did a complete 180 on immigration from the decades wrong idea that immigrants steal jobs and lower wages to a modern Democratic immigration policy. He's not going to have PACs, except that nursing one, that one is cool now. He isn't a Democrat, except now he is and is claiming he's always been to win a race. 

He wants his indie label, but explains it as just being a liberal Democrat. We have those, they're just Democrats who are open about who they are. They don't pick and choose the label when it's convenient.

And if his policies were backed by the majority of Americans he'd have put them into law, instead of just giving vague ideas without specifics. He's got a plethora of policy, but I want to see how he makes those policies law.

But Sanders is championing liberal, progressive policies that have been core tenets of liberals since FDR. That's a fact. Clinton is also supporting some of those. A lot less, but some of those.

Why are you so deeply concerned with whether Bernie runs as an (I) or a (D). It should be his policies that matter, and his record. I imagine the fact that the Democratic party post LBJ has inched rightward every year is part of it. I also know that I've voted Democrat in 100% of the elections I've voted in, but was registered independent for most of that time, as I have no need to swear fealty to one party or the other.</Comment><Comment author="jckgat" date="1448072159.0" date_utc="1448043359.0" id="cx74lf2" parent_id="t1_cx74hcb" type="reply">Because I am a Democrat, and I see no reason to look well in one that panders to me and pretends to be one when it's convenient and eschews it when he he's comfortable in a seat.

Even some of the policies of Democrats today are to the right of Republicans of yesterday. You look at tax policy, Wall Street regulation, and war, more and more do we see a shift to the right from Democrats.

So, is it disingenuous that Bernie runs as a Democrat? Honestly, I think that's debatable. For someone who is a die hard Democrat, I can totally see that feeling that he's an insurgent. However, Bernie's been caucusing with Democrats for ages, so in a two party system, he's comfortable there.

Additionally, third party candidates make it no where in runs for the White House. So, if he wins the nomination, he ends up with funding from the DNC. That's a strategic move. Whether or not you like that, that's up to you to decide.

Personally, I've been registered as party unaffiliated since I was 18. While I tend to agree with Democrats more often, I've found many times that they're not progressive enough to my liking. And while I identify more often with Democratic policies or positions, I'm completely unhappy with a two party system. To me, party loyalty creates a slippery slope to forgoing accountability&#8212;you're asked to trust your leaders and party without hesitation.

When it comes down to it, I think Sanders is more Democrat than his rivals because the party itself has shifted over the decades. In Inequality For All, Robert Reich brings up a question people have asked him, (paraphrased) "to fix our economic issues, who should we emulate." His response is America (but from a previous era).

Sanders, while being the ardent progressive that he is, is definitely a Democrat (or simply a progressive) of a bygone era.

And, if it seems that he's pandering or trying to convince you of what you think he's not, then it is in your right to not trust him. But, I think many who are disenfranchised with politics, especially those on the left, see Democrats that have had the title for most of their career aren't deserving of the title either.</Comment><Comment author="Ephem-eric" date="1448079445.0" date_utc="1448050645.0" id="cx79e84" parent_id="t1_cx745cx" type="reply">&gt; He picks up the (D) label because that's what he is, and he's more representative of that party's ethos than Hillary is.

He picked up the D label in 2006 for his Senate primary, then dropped it right after winning the primary, then picked it up again a few weeks ago... If he hadn't dropped it after the 2006 Senate primary I would be more inclined to believe that he decided he's more representative of the party's ethos. The whole dropping the label right after winning the primary and ensuring there would be no other Democrats siphoning off votes is just a case of political expediency.

Some places actually chose that option instead of letting the federal government handle it. 

Not only do they not have massive unfunded liabilities (like with Social Security), there are zero unfunded liabilities. Retirees not only get around 2x - 3x more than what Social Security would have given them, their death benefit is 850x more than what Social Security offers. AND they can pass on their entire retirement down to their children, unlike Social Security. Besides, do you honestly want Republicans in charge of your retirement, with the ability to raise your retirement age, change cost of living increases or even reduce your benefits? (I'm always confused why liberals trust the government so much, but not the GOP. It's like they don't realize they go together.)

Oh, and don't forget Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt in 12 years.

It's an interesting question and I would respect either answer.  I understand not pandering is what makes Bernie Bernie, however at this stage of the game who gives a fuck-  

Whats more important implementing free college and not letting Hilary in White House- or insisting that 10k refugees come to America?  The whole refugee is a political statement to make conservatives sound racist and a conservative thing to make liberals sound like complete morons.  

Its not like they will die on the street if we dont take htem, its a convenient politcal show and not a real issue, and I would consider it more strategy than pandering for bernie to switch on the issue.  I think it would be a huge boost.  Jewish people are only a small part fo the population but they always hit the polls and often vote together.  Can't turn your back on their interests and survive in Politcs

I dont support bernie or any republican I am a libertarian student of politics observing this from the outside and I would say its good politics for bernie to switch, and the refugee situation is kind of crazy.  </Comment><Comment author="RedAccount1330" date="1448096186.0" date_utc="1448067386.0" id="cx7ixsl" parent_id="t1_cx7g233" type="reply">Isn't Bernie Jewish?

How? How are "righteous religious people" a danger to *everyone*? I'm sure you disagree with Trump and Carson calling all Muslims terrorists, right? Then how can you make a statement like this?

Google defines "terrorists" as "a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims." Google also defines "terrorism" as "the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims."

You got it all wrong, I support stereotyping.  It's natural and normal.  We go through experiences in life and notice patterns which shape how our mind thinks.  I think if you don't stereotype to a degree, you're either stupid, or lying. 

I'm demonstrating there is a double standard.  Christians and white people are A-O.K. to stereotype.  Muslims and black people? Not so much.

They are run by moderators who are humans with biases and beliefs. Just because it is called r/politics does not mean it represents all political beliefs equally. r/politics is a very far leftist run and moderated subreddit. 

The subreddits moderation determines the content that is presented and the opinions and ideas that are censored and the narratives that get pushed. 

There is a reason that r/politics got booted off the front page, a location that even 2X chromosomes has a place on. 

r/politics unfortunately now shares the same breathing room and credibility for moderation as subreddits such as r/conspiracy.

That is the opposite of Democracy. For example we want to legalize weed. If we persuade those who oppose us on the matter with facts, evidence, logic and legalizing weed is voted into law, we have achieved our goals within a Democratic framework. If we instead use propaganda to manipulate the minds of people with lies, use emotion instead of reason to create mob mentality. If we respond to those who oppose our objective by refusing to hear their arguments, resorting to intimidation and fear tactics, not working within a democratic framework that includes the freedom for people to disagree with us without fear of retribution and Legal Weed is made the law  of the land, then we become despots, tyrants. Do you not understand for example that Marxism is an example of political ideology on the far left and fascism is a political ideology on the far right of the political spectrum. Though these ideologies represent extremes on both the left and also the right both are dangerous, oppressive and do not belong in a Democracy. of totalitarianism (extreme leftist ideology) and fascism (extreme right wing ideology)  are much the same thing even though people who embrace either ideology typically hate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum. </Comment><Comment author="rockytheboxer" date="1448077469.0" date_utc="1448048669.0" id="cx783w6" parent_id="t1_cx778bp" type="reply">This was an incredibly long paragraph that said nothing to refute what /u/TheAylius said.  </Comment><Comment author="Charlithinks" date="1448078111.0" date_utc="1448049311.0" id="cx78j02" parent_id="t1_cx783w6" type="reply">Rocky i am learning how to use an a new ap to communicate on Reddit.

There is just no left-wing equivalent to the sheer crazy and violent extremism on the right. 

Left-wing "extremists" call for redistribution of wealth from the rich to the working class, and organise camp outs on wall street to protest, where they get beaten up by police.

Right-wing extremists shoot up schools, churches, military bases, and call for bloody revolution to overthrow the US government. And this isn't fringe right-wing anymore. You have federal right-wing politicians espousing the  killing/deporting/rounding up of minorities they are afraid of or hate. Their organisations also lobby governments in third world countries to murder and imprison homosexuals.

How can you believe this to be untrue?

Cars by their very nature are operated in areas occupied by others, routinely at closing velocities of 120 mph within two feet of each other.

Private pilots rarely fly over 100 hours per year.  How many hours per year does the average driver spend behind the wheel?

Those with heart conditions, like Inhofe's, have NO business whatsoever operating a plane, given the threats they predictably pose when a heart attack strikes while they are operating the plane.  Those laws, rules and prohibitions exist for good reason.  Inhofe's overblown ego is no reason whatsoever to eliminate or weaken them.

The FAA created the Sport Pilot license in 2004, which as you know allows pilots *with less training required* to fly airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of 1320 lbs and no medical certification other than a current driver's license.

Not only did this attract pilots who otherwise may not have qualified to fly, it has resulted in many thousands of pilots who have health conditions like heart disease selling off their 172s and buying lighter airplanes.

Contrary to your assertion, there has not been a rash of sport aircraft falling from the sky with dead pilots at the stick. 

Would I get in an airplane with Inhofe?  Hell no.  I suppose I could fly right seat and be safe in the event he stroked out, but he's a dick and I don't want to fly with him regardless.

Instead, I'm saying it's not worth risking the threat that even one of them poses by behaving recklessly with their own lives and those of others.  It's one thing to roll the dice and risk your own life, it's quite another to risk the lives of others while operating airplanes or any other fast-moving or heavy vehicle.  That's where we should draw the line as a society.  

&gt;I wouldn't be opposed to a legal requirement for a pilot with such health conditions to disclose these to potential passengers, as these people have a right to know.

I think we have to go much further than that option and require pilots with such health conditions to at least fly with other trained pilots at all times.  The reason is simple.  Reckless people have no right to endanger others, regardless of whether they've been informed or not.  

The average person doesn't understand the dangers involved.  The worst time to find that out is when they're up in the sky and suddenly flying without a pilot.

For as much as EVERYONE seems to absolutely hate Fallin, I have no idea how she got re-elected. Inhofe and Lankford are terrible. 

This state has a lot of problems, but they seem to be getting worse the more magic supply side economics fairy dust they throw at the process.  The problem is that the majority of the state is highly religious, so they vote for the candidates that pander to them on social issues and completely ignore the economic ramifications of doing so.  It's very frustrating.

The idea of Fallon running for Congress is scary as hell.  

Pruitt has been busy wasting taxpayer money fighting legal battles to appease the religious right but are obvious losing battles. The lawsuit against the federal government over CO having legal marijuana for instance. (whatever happened the holy pillar of conservatism that is State's Rights?). And not to be outdone, he followed that up with the lawsuit over the ten commandments monument that was erected on the state capitol grounds (in direct violation of the state constitution, which also runs afoul of the separation clause of the first amendment of the federal constitution).

This potential pipeline of teabagging asshat politicians will do their best to continue flushing this state down the toilet until the voters wake up and vote them out.

We are talking about general aviation here, not Lear jets.  And I have heard about this "issue" for decades.  The FAA medical exam requirements for private pilots are in many cases completely ridiculous.

Read the article.  The only example of an airplane crash they cite is one where a 69 year old crashed his plane into a tree.  It was found he was on several medications that would have prevented him from getting a medical certificate.  Guess what?  He didn't have a medical certificate.  Did that stop him from flying?

Overall, there are very few issues about which I am more familiar than the average redditor.  This happens to be one of them.

He simply happens to be mostly correct on this issue.  Truthfully, I think his proposal (from what I can see of it) goes a bit too far, but maybe that's designed to have room to give.

The FAA, while doing a lot of things right, has always been *very* slow to address any possible changes.  They have been under instruction for about six years now to reexamine their medical certification system and either streamline it or justify its complexity.  They keep kicking the ball down the road.</Comment><Comment author="BigScarySmokeMonster" date="1448092983.0" date_utc="1448064183.0" id="cx7hc2a" parent_id="t1_cx7foph" type="reply">I would imagine part of this is the absolute shitstorm that would happen for them if some pilot didn't get enough medical scrutiny, and crashed a passenger jet.  

Relaxing the standards of air safety are going to be a touchy subject, and it would seem to me that it's not really in the FAA's interest to roll that ball.  Even if Sen. Snowball gets his bill through, if something happens, the media and public are sure to blame the FAA for it.</Comment><Comment author="syncopator" date="1448095937.0" date_utc="1448067137.0" id="cx7it9x" parent_id="t1_cx7hc2a" type="reply">As far as I know, Inhofe's bill doesn't affect commercial pilot medicals at all.  There are 3 classes of medical certification, each with different requirements and different durations of validity.

Airline pilots and pretty much any pilot who flies passengers commercially or large air freight planes needs a first class medical, which is valid for 12 months if you're under 40 and six months if you're over 40.

All other commercial pilots (agriculture, flight instructors, etc.) require a second class, which is valid for 12 months regardless of age.

Private pilots (not for hire in any fashion) require a third class medical, which is valid for 60 months if you are under 40 and 24 months if you are over 40.

What Inhofe is proposing is that *private* pilots be able to go 48 months between exams, and that these exams could be performed by any doctor.  Right now, a medical certificate can only be issued by a doctor who has signed up with the FAA to provide medicals.  Many doctors refuse to do so, as they can end up having to answer questions in the event a pilot has a medical incident after being issued a certificate.

Third-class medicals are far from intensive.  Eyesight, hearing, balance, and a urine test plus a comprehensive health questionnaire.  Any serious health condition that is discovered between medical certifications disqualifies the applicant from a simple exam.  Heart conditions and such require "special issuance" certificates directly from the FAA, which typically take months or years regardless of how positively one's own doctor views the applicant's health.

This has resulted in the recent growth of the "sport pilot" class of aircraft, which by several characteristics including max speed and weight are included in a special class of aircraft that only require a driver's license in lieu of a medical certificate.  Thousands of otherwise disqualified pilots are now flying sport aircraft, and not a single study by the FAA has shown an increase in health-related airplane accidents.

[The FAA created the Sport Pilot class of licenses in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States#Sport_pilot), which allows pilots with the proper training and **a driver's license** (no other medical requirement) to fly aircraft with a takeoff weight less than 1320 pounds and no more than one passenger.

For decades now, pilots have been lobbying the FAA for medical rules that make sense.  This isn't something Inhofe just started.

The argument (which I agree with) is that for small airplanes carrying less than 4 passengers, a driver's license should suffice as a medical certification.

Think about it.  These same people are free to drive a 5000 pound road missile around, and roads are by nature congested with other drivers and surrounded by houses/businesses/sidewalks.  People also spend much more time driving than piloting airplanes.  The odds that someone will die at the wheel are much much greater than dying in the cockpit, and dying at the wheel carries much much greater odds of injuring/killing a bystander than an airplane falling out of the sky.

There also is **a lot more to it** than a few more doctor visits.  The FAA is widely known, especially in the medical department, for red tape and non-sensical delays and requests.  The expense alone ends up deterring most people who have any issues.

Really if we don't require grandpa to get a medical certification to drive that 40-foot diesel-pusher motor home with the Kia hooked on behind, why do we require him to get one to fly a 1500 pound airplane around for an hour?</Comment><Comment author="fuzzo" date="1448065770.0" date_utc="1448036970.0" id="cx70d0k" parent_id="t1_cx6zrjl" type="reply">rationalize much? https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/3tkr9n/sen_jim_inhofe_an_81yearold_avid_pilot_who_had/cx6zlie</Comment><Comment author="syncopator" date="1448066415.0" date_utc="1448037615.0" id="cx70scw" parent_id="t1_cx70d0k" type="reply">Dude, I have my pilot's license as does my father.

Of course flying is inherently dangerous.  How much safer would it be if we did away with the class system and required annual physicals?  Are you suggesting the same physical requirements and disqualifiers for sport pilots as airline pilots?

There is no argument at all the single most effective and simple way to make flying safer than it is today would be requiring a fuel level officer to visually confirm and sign off every single airplane prior to takeoff.</Comment><Comment author="Bluthhousing" date="1448079382.0" date_utc="1448050582.0" id="cx79csc" parent_id="t3_3tkraz" type="comment">Perhaps this is fine?

(As an aside, at the end of the month, USA FREEDOM will change the manner in which these records are collected, but it does not prevent the collection. In some ways, the program will be more intrusive under USA FREEDOM than under the preceding version of section 215.)

This story is about a program through which the government collected metadata on emails traveling between the US and abroad. In late 2011, they shut that particular program down. Most of the precise reasons why they decided to do that are still classified, but one reason was made public--in a nutshell, the government felt it could get that information through other authorities which had fewer limitations on the purposes for which they could gather and search the data, so they shut down this old program in December 2011 and re-opened another one with similar capabilities and fewer limits.</Comment><Comment author="D0CT0R_LEG1T" date="1448113750.0" date_utc="1448084950.0" id="cx7qqhz" parent_id="t1_cx7qjzi" type="reply">Hey as I always say, when I'm wrong I'm wrong.

The problem is, this only works in real, physical institutions and communities, with some semblance of accountability, reputation and voluntary association/disassociation. It works in academia. You can publish scientific racism or holocaust denial and you'll just make yourself a permanent pariah and a laughing stock, with no prospects for ever being taken seriously by your peers again. 

The fact is, in a real-life situation, if you're caught lying to people, those people will no longer associate with you. This is *not* the case on open public forums &#8211; like reddit, for example &#8211; which get overrun by neo-nazis and then enable them continuously. In a public forum, you're free to spout your bullshit with zero consequences, long after it's been refuted. They'll spam stormfront copypasta and then in ten minutes, they're just hanging out and having a chat about their favorite television shows like nothing happened because they're coddled by the lack of community control and protected from any social consequences. The stormfront crew here, for instance, routinely fabricates data &#8211; shocking, I know. Take [this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3tnjdu/pakistanis_views_on_isis_showcase_worrying_trend/cx7to4z?context=4), from just this morning. Okay, so you've taken the ten minutes to check the sources they posted and quickly pointed out that it's all total frabrication and fraud. Does that do anything to counter the propaganda or impede their recruitment efforts? You can go around debunking their nonsense with their own sources all day long and it will only get all your posts censored. They're not going to have any of it. It doesn't matter how transparently obvious you make their bullshit: you won't convince a fascist to stop being a fascist.

I don't agree with state enforced censorship, but if you're going to deal with problems like this without the nanny state, or the nanny corporation, for that matter, that means you have to physically fight fascists to deny them a platform and expel them from public discourse. Otherwise, they just dominate it until they push out everyone else and bully anyone even semi-literate into staying quiet, which has been the case on this website, with administrative support.

Furthermore, you need to delineate "offensive" and "oppressive." Telling someone to go fuck a cactus might be offensive, but it probably doesn't systematically marginalize them or pummel them into compliance.</Comment><Comment author="Kerplonk" date="1448143512.0" date_utc="1448114712.0" id="cx7yiyv" parent_id="t1_cx7w57e" type="reply">Your comment is in a way argues against the point you are trying to make.

That makes me think, everybody is so eager to identify themselves in some way as a 'minority.' 
  
What is ironic is that most of the people calling themselves 'minorities' in the US, are on a global scale anything but a minority. And the people thought of as the 'majority' in the US on a global scale, *are a minority.*  

Isn't it time we recognize this and start treating these people how we would an endangered species? Meaning we should recognize their importance and be very mindful of any disruption to their habitat so they are pushed no further towards the brink, and can begin a healthy recovery.

What happens if the US becomes 'majority minority'?
Then what label are 'minorities' going to assemble under? 

All minority has come to mean lately is a grievance group with a shared nominal identity that is trying to extract something from some other group.  
  
As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this whole 'minority craze' as of late has come about as a result of the Democratic party fanning the flames(throwing gasoline really,) as a divide and conquer tactic to win elections.

We're now at a stage where people have grown up entirely in both a post-9/11 and post-Columbine US and see giving up their rights in exchange for safety as normal.  Someone who was 4-5 years old on 9/11 is a freshman in college today.  They grew up with police officers in schools and chains on the doors and the constant threat of another terrorist attack.

They also grew up with a big fight for LGBT rights where those against it were saying some very vicious and harmful things.  We're having similar fights with immigration reform and people are starting to acknowledge that the US hasn't solved the racial divide by ignoring it or electing one black president.  

All these things are coming together and there is now tremendous appetite to silence people who feed intolerance because everyone has friends who are being wronged and want to see everyone be equal.  

The problem is that while we should be trying to fix this injustice we don't have the appreciation for the freedom we enjoy in the US (freedom by the way that was absolutely necessary not so long ago to even talk about gay rights or injustice against Black Americans and get to the point where progress could be made).  

It's created a large number of people who think they have the right to not be offended and especially here on Reddit we've seen it so much that we've given the name "Social Justice Warrior" to it.

There was a pretty good Oxford Union debate on "Freedom of Speech and the Right to Offend" that can be found here:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOAFgXcJkZ2zeWTGHpR56tAphiqmTZxjK

I think everyone should watch it.  It provides arguments from both sides and can be helpful as a tool to think through it and figure out where you stand if you haven't given it serious thought before.

Also I'm 31 now so I was a senior in HS when 9/11 happened.  I'm also gay.  I had a front row seat to everything going down and the advantage of growing up in a time when norm-challenging groups like Rage Against the Machine or Marilyn Manson could exist without being accused of causing school shootings.</Comment><Comment author="mjonas" date="1448142780.0" date_utc="1448113980.0" id="cx7ya51" parent_id="t1_cx7x49i" type="reply">I remember seeing these when they were new, and thought "Oh shit, some of this is gonna get pulled down". so I downloaded them.

Sure enough. the Kate Brooks video is now [Private Video].

Guess the OxfordUnion wasn't a safe enough space for her.

That was the best video in defence of "Freedom of Speech and the Right to Offend", she was opposed but she really self destructed.

"What we want freedom of speech, and we want freedom of speech for everyone. And unfortunately that means that we have to get these guys (*pointing at proposition*) to shut up for a while, and give the platform to somebody else." - Kate Brooks

-edit Maybe not as simple as it seemed (Devil's Advocate, not knowing the video would be uploaded etc)

You've got people like T. Coates, accepting an award for a book and saying things like 'Every time I turn on the TV I see violence perpetrated on a black body...'  that's obviously not good, but Listen brother! 

Do you know how much violence black bodies perpetrate on white bodies? On both an absolute and per capita basis the rate is astronomical compared to the other way around. 

Why is there somewhere approaching zero 'national conversation' about that? 
  
Why are the media airwaves so often filled to the gills with these outrages that turn out to be based on lies?

Earlier this year, I went to an event at a university near me. I ran into a former co-worker who was born in New Zealand. I say "Hey! It's my favorite kiwi!" He was about 20 feet away, so I had to yell it a bit. You should have seen the looks of horror on some of these college students faces. 

Apparently, these students were unaware that "kiwi" is an appropriate term for a New Zealander. But, not knowing this term, they assumed it was a slur and some were quite offended. It really blew my mind...they didn't know the term, so they immediately assumed hate speech. James says he gets that shit all the time.

&gt;The term encompasses all non-white groups, emphasizing common experiences of racism.

That definition has two humongous assumptions both of which are hideously wrong. 

1. All non-whites experience racism the exact same way. 

2. All non-whites experience racism from whites only. Or is it not racism when it's two non-white people as long as whites exist somewhere?

All this is is happy "we are the world" crap only without the white people and in fact making white people the enemy.

Occasionally he has on a decent guest, but that doesn't always save the show. He had Bill Nye on a few months back and his other guests could not give less of a shit about science and stated as much.

Despite the 9/11 hysteria, who would have rather grown up with WWI, WWII, Korea or Vietnam? During Vietnam kids were routinely drafted and sent as cannon fodder to die in an unwinnable war. Millennials don't know what it is to struggle so they look for struggles that are fake. Anxiety among my generation is through the roof yet they have nothing to fear compared to older generations. The threat of terrorism is nothing compared to the real threat of being shipped off to 'Nam like most of your buddies or Adolf Hitler swallowing up the world. Less than 1% of the US population actually serves in the military. In previous generations, a majority of the male population did. In the 19th century, there was no social safety net and kids were sent to work 15 hour work days. That might be horrible, but it means you know what's really a threat and what isn't.

Once a precedent has been set for exactly how and why power like this can be used, someone is going to find a way to abuse it.  

Part of why limiting free speech is such a slippery slope is because some opinion or belief which is interpreted as being offensive by one group may be an integral part of the opinions and beliefs of another group, and in turn the opinions held by the offended group may themselves be offensive to the group which they were offended by.  In this situation, whose speech should be limited?  Both groups, or neither?  If the groups are equal in size, it would likely be one of those two choices, as limiting the freedoms of either group without limiting the freedoms of the other would likely cause some sort of public outcry... but what if the group whose speech was being limited was small enough in comparison to the larger one that the majority was not concerned?  Suddenly there are laws in place which favor the freedoms of one group over those of another.  Those who are part of the various majority groups for whom there are fewer restrictions are happy, and those who are a part of the various minority groups whose speech has been limited suddenly find themselves without a voice, as they legally cannot speak up against the larger groups which have stolen it from them.  It is possible that very few of these millennials would complain if members of the KKK and other notorious hate groups were suddenly forced into silence, but where is the line drawn, and by whom?  I can only assume that it is drawn by those who find themselves with the power to do so, and it would only be a matter of time before that power fell into the hands of someone with less than noble intentions.

If we give up even a little bit of our freedom to speak freely, we will eventually give up much more than that.  I'm inclined to believe that it's the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it's the basis of the entire concept of personal freedom.  If I can't even speak up about something I feel is wrong for fear of legal repercussions, it's basically the same as saying that whatever it is I'm upset about cannot and will not be challenged by anyone, and if I'm upset about something that is limiting my personal freedom in a significant way then I will never *be* free.  For example, if it had been illegal to promote the idea that homosexuality was a normal human behavior because the very concept of it was offensive to the sensibilities of various religious groups, it would have been almost impossible to have a gay rights movement, and gay marriage never would have been legalized because no one would have been able to argue in favor of it.  Public opinion does not change without someone who is willing to argue against the status quo.

I've probably ranted enough about this, but it goes without saying that, as a very liberal American, I am very upset that other liberals are the ones who appear to be supporting this recent movement to limit free speech.  The idea of liberalism can't even exist without free speech.  They're cutting their own throats so they don't have to worry about anyone's feelings being hurt, and I don't understand it at all.</Comment><Comment author="DragonEevee1" date="1448110470.0" date_utc="1448081670.0" id="cx7pg3m" parent_id="t3_3tme38" type="comment">Scary </Comment><Comment author="Justtryme90" date="1448110681.0" date_utc="1448081881.0" id="cx7pj53" parent_id="t3_3tme38" type="comment">People shouldn't say offensive things about any group.

Bernie's speech was that we need to come together like we did before under FDR (elected 4 times) and what we as a country could do for ourselves moving forward, and additionally working *with* the Arab middle east as they tried to mitigate the war within their region and major religion; Hilliary's was about Americans need to lead the charge against ISIS *again,* dominate everything, and sell more weapons. Isn't one of the definitions of insanity thinking that banging your head against the wall will get rid of your headache?

In Bernie's speech I was crying because finally we have someone talking the truth; in Hilliary's she manufactured some tears to go along with a story about an actual selfless individual helping others during the Charlie Hebdo assassinations, something she just doesn't even understand.

lol. The Saudis and Iranians have been playing a giant game over who will get to dominate the region. The Iranians are the ones who started the civil war in Yemen.

But you will not hear any words about lightning or its prevention from Republican candidates.

What we *are* literally hearing are pledges - not mere implications nor hints, but actual promises from the leading Republican candidates for President of the United States - to throw away the Bill of Rights, ignore every single civil rights law ever passed, ignore all fundamental American values, and:

* Force Muslims to register for a special database.

* Block refugees from obtaining asylum in the United States if and because they are Muslim, or even (illegally) block them from living in certain states as pledged by Republican governors.

These are pledges made by Republican leaders across the country in a chorus of violently hysterical hatemongering, imputing to random people *fleeing* from the violence of terrorists the crimes of those terrorists by the flimsiest of religious associations.  And once again, all because of a threat thousands of times less likely than being struck by lightning.

Unfortunately, such rhetoric is having the effect of a crack pipe hit on the racist and xenophobic sectors of society, being treated as a political green light by domestic extremists to openly call for pogroms and terrorist attacks on Muslims or even just random foreigners.  

The irony, of course, is that these [Republican-leaning terrorists](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html?_r=0) are statistically a far more abundant source of murder in the United States than foreign terrorism, and Republicans have historically objected to law enforcement scrutiny of these groups and individuals.  No database for Nazis when you're planning to adopt their platform, apparently.

All of this should make every American wonder just how far down the rabbit hole Republicans intend to take this monstrous farce.  Will Donald Trump (or Drumpf - his family's original German name before they changed it) be calling for Muslims to be wearing special armbands and patches sewn into their clothes next?  If that fails to shock sufficiently, will his next move be to call for numbers to be tattooed on their wrists?  Perhaps for cattle cars to be used in the mass-deportations he has already promised?

Since Ben Carson has taken to equating random innocent people fleeing chaos to "rabid dogs," perhaps he will decide that a dog is too good a comparison and move down the ladder to [cockroaches](http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_rwanda4.html)?

Since the words coming out of these candidates mouths are now routinely outright lies rather than mere fibs or exaggerations, and shatter the boundaries of even sane consideration let alone learned credulity, it's clear that the Republican presidential campaign is already on something of a runaway train.  

The fact that *all* leading candidates for the GOP nomination are concretely pledging to violate the Bill of Rights, not to mention international law; that they are pledging to essentially act outside the law on the basis of whipped-up mob violence, paranoia, and direct personal control of military and law enforcement organs; and that they plan to do this to monitor, segregate, and expel (if not worse) a minority group; makes clear on which track of history this train is running away, and to what end it leads.

Let us all hope it leads to a Democratic landslide, because the alternative is already unthinkable.<Comments><Comment author="seanosul" date="1448126240.0" date_utc="1448097440.0" id="cx7uby6" parent_id="t3_3tnxvh" type="comment">I think you missed the mid terms.

This is also a reaction to the stupidity of the Democrat politicians. 

For decades, liberals have been preaching that Islam is peaceful, multiculturalism is good and that illegal immigration should be embraced. What you see now is a passionate rejection of that ideology. 

Islam is NOT peaceful. The louder that you shout that it is, the louder people are disagree with you when Muslims starts blowing up hundreds of innocent people. 

Multiculturalism is failing. The more liberals stick their heads in the sand and ignore Muslim enclaves that start rejecting national law in favor of Sharia Law, the more people are going to angrily reject importing thousands of refugees who have zero desire assimilating.

What's need is for liberals to acknowledge reality and come to the middle ground. Prioritize Christian refugees for example. Not only are we legally required to prioritize refugees targeted for religious persecution/genocide vs. those just escaping conflict in general, it's the smart thing to do. We KNOW these people and their kids aren't going to start attacking the very country that welcomes them. 

Yet we have a Democratic President who says almost NOTHING about the systematic elimination of Christianity in the Middle East and instead allies himself with Iran, effectively handing the country who wants to wipe Israel off the Earth nuclear weapons. No wonder people are forced to escalate their rhetoric with this kind of "leadership". </Comment><Comment author="metaobject" date="1448151168.0" date_utc="1448122368.0" id="cx81rs9" parent_id="t1_cx80lw5" type="reply">How will you determine which refugees are good, peace-loving, halo-adorned Christians?

A few reasons why this is fallacious:

1. We can't control lightning. We can control terrorism, at least in principle, as we're dealing with humans.

2. We know the effects of lightning and how many die. We don't know how bad a terrorist attack could be. It's a total unknown.

3. Terrorism is a matter of justice. Being murdered invokes morality and everything that goes along with it.

4. Terrorism undermines a functioning society. It affects everyone in everything they do. A society ceases to be able to function properly when terrorism looms. It's fundamentally pernicious to all civilization. Lightning obviously is not.

5. Terrorism gets worse if you don't contain it. Lightning does not.

But then he said something about letting chemical companies do what they want on their property w/ toxic waste. 'We can trust them to not fuck up their property.' 

Yeah, except when more money can be made quicker when you do it the dirty way. And once they get theirs, it's all about helicoptering the fuck outta there, on to the next victim.

Lighten up and stop trying to act like you're offended. This is the natural course of things: Islamic terrorists attack, people respond with scapegoating. And mind you, Syrian refugees at the moment are one hell of a good scapegoat&#8212;and honestly it's warranted at the moment. We know ISIS will attempt to infiltrate and take advantage of refugees.

But if you actually think that all of this hoopla going on about every Muslim US citizen being ID'd and put on a watch list and given a crescent moon and star badge and being shipped off to concentration camps is anything but a liberals wet dream for a landslide Democratic election, come back to reality.</Comment><Comment author="TRUMPTRUMPTRUMPTRUMP" date="1448144740.0" date_utc="1448115940.0" id="cx7yyw3" parent_id="t3_3tnxvh" type="comment">Wow the left has gone overboard because people see what's happening in Paris and planned accordingly.

But you will not hear any words about lightning or its prevention from Republican candidates.

I hear this argument a lot, but I don't think it's quite right.

Particularly after a terrorist attack, it is rational to have terrorism on one's mind as a legitimate threat, even if the raw data says that your odds of dying in a terrorist attack are quite low. For an analogous case, suppose that you are in a bank, and a bank robber walks in. He has a gun, but he informs everyone that if they get on the floor, they will not be harmed. "The probability of me actually dying in a bank robbery is extremely low," you say as you remain standing. "I'm much more likely to die of heart disease, or a car crash, or even a household accident. Therefore, I feel justified in behaving however I feel like in this situation, knowing that statistics will keep me safe."  But it seems like something has gone wrong here. Your raw probability of dying in a bank robbery is low, true, but the context you're in can raise the probability and make it rational to care about. Similarly, perhaps the recent terror attacks, combined with ISIS's stated goals, make it more rational for people to care about and take steps to prevent terror attacks?

Furthermore, note that, on the face of it, it seems like we as a nation can take active steps to help reduce the number of terror attacks we suffer, through our domestic and foreign policy decisions. You won't hear a presidential candidate or anyone else talk about preventing lightning strikes, because that's a completely random event that basically cannot be prevented, aside from basic common sense safety measures. Terror attacks do not seem to be random though; they target specific populations in response to specific political and economic circumstances, and those circumstances are under our control to some degree. Look at cancer research for a comparison; the probability of any one person contracting and dying of cancer, particularly a young person, is rather low, and yet people spend large amounts of time and money trying to prevent cancer, precisely because it *can* be prevented.</Comment><Comment author="jrsherrod" date="1448147030.0" date_utc="1448118230.0" id="cx7zvfs" parent_id="t1_cx7zaf6" type="reply">This is a convoluted rationalization which ignores the origin of the majority of terrorist attacks on US soil: white men.</Comment><Comment author="MashE-1776" date="1448152479.0" date_utc="1448123679.0" id="cx82g25" parent_id="t1_cx7zvfs" type="reply">Oh good there wasnt enough BLM in this Refugee Narrative.

You can learn to understand it, you can learn to somewhat control it, but you cannot stop it from doing its thing. 

In the  aftermath of the Paris attacks there were people who thought we should be proactive in our approach to ISIS (fight) then there were people who would prefer to deny the existance of a Islamic Terror threat (Flight).  Neither is good, bad. Right or wrong. They are instincts and they occur before your thinking brain kicks in. 

For the President of the United States to then declare half of his country as "un-American" for their instincts is both the saddest, and the greatest thing of all time. 

Not only did he seal his fate in the history books as an unpopular President with this stance, but he has potentially cost his party the 2016 election.

_______________________

The only people who win out when there's a terrorist attack are fascists; in every sense of the word.

You have the complete Islamofascist authoritarianism coming from ISIS, the oligarches and corporatists that are happy to take on the economic stances that thrived in fascist states, and the bigots the world over that will ramp up racist and religious hatred and xenophobia.

The Klan, the neo-Nazis and the Minute Men in America, the EDL and various National Fronts in Europeon countries will be used as useful idiots by the oligarchs, all who have vested interests in the defense sector. They'll be used as leverage to bolster the claim that we need all out war. The right wing bigots will treat the refugees as scum and a threat (even though they're running from the same people we're threatened by) and the refugees will then feel dejected. Dejection is exactly what ISIS wants Muslims to feel, because it makes their recruiting efforts that much easier. Muslims in isolation are easier to manipulate and turn into Jihadists.

The oligarches get paid for advocating a war they don't have to fight themselves, the bigots get to reconfirm their bigotry as normative; because their views will be held up as "popular support" for the war effort and ISIS will turn thousands of more muslims into extremist soldiers (or lone wolves) because of it.

This isn't a war against Islam, this a war against fascism; same as it ever was.

The nation states, however, will only see one front, albeit the loudest front, which is ISIS/Daesh. They will ignore the inborne fascist problem, largely because they profit from it.

Fascism opposes millenarian religious movements such as ISIS because they are subversive. Fascists require that its adherents obey constituted authority. ISIS has demonstrated a clear disobedience to constituted authority. 

The word "fascism" has been used as a scapegoat by the left.

You created Trump as much as the Republicans did. And when he's President it won't be fascism,  it won't be totalitarianism,  it will be democracy plain and simple.

How is Trump a fascist or xenophobic? His company is global, if he were either of those he wouldn't have had his business success. Is nationalism now just seen as fascism? Do we want to become Germany where you get yelled and screamed at for showing the German flag on TV? Nationalism is just about the most American thing ever. Should Muslims be put into databases and tracked, and mosques banned outright? Absolutely not. But, IMO, if there are U.S. Muslims that share ideology and sympathy with ISIS and if there are mosques in this country that harbor such beliefs, then yes there needs to be something done about them.

[Here's an article about that CDC study Obama funded back in 2013.](http://www.gunsandammo.com/politics/cdc-gun-research-backfires-on-obama/)  What did it conclude:

1.  Armed citizens are less likely to be injured by an attacker

2.  Defensive uses of guns are common, with between 500,000 and 3 million uses per year.

3.  Mass shootings and accidental firearm deaths account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths, and both are declining

4.  "Interventions&#8221; (i.e, gun control) such as background checks, so-called assault rifle bans and gun-free zones produce &#8220;mixed&#8221; results

5.  Gun buyback programs are "innefective" at reducing crime

6.  Stolen guns and retail/gun show purchases account for very little crime

7.  The vast majority of gun-related deaths are not homicides, but suicides

Make what you want of it, but there you go.  The article also discusses a bit why the ban was first instituted.  Basically the man in charge of the CDC was aggressively anti-gun and perpetuated myths in order to further his agenda.  I don't believe that's a problem any more.  Any research on gun violence that is unbiased won't tell us something we don't already know.</Comment><Comment author="Goliath_D" date="1448152310.0" date_utc="1448123510.0" id="cx82cud" parent_id="t1_cx80rp7" type="reply">For anyone interested, here is a link to the paper.

In other words, it was not an Obama study on Gun violence. It is the first step that responsible academics do when researching a problem.

lol guys its just a review article which is highest in the [hierarchy of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_evidence)! Don't make too much of its conclusions!

Also if you actually read the study you would know the majority of the studies were published after 1996.

Yes, and that first step showed that current evidence directly contradicts anti gun talking points.

The majority of mass shootings were done by the mentally ill and the majority of suicides are also done by the mentally ill. If we made it harder to get guns for the mentally ill, it may help both of those problems. Obviously if someone wants to shoot up a school, nothing will really stop them from getting the weapons to do it, either legally or illegally, but we can do things so that happens less often. </Comment><Comment author="BeartrapSandwich" date="1448152535.0" date_utc="1448123735.0" id="cx82h56" parent_id="t1_cx81wbh" type="reply">I'm with /u/barryicide as a socialist gun nut.

This was put in place because the CDC was not studying violence but was engaged in partisan gun control advocacy. 

And note the Dickey Amendment only effects the CDC. The has been plenty of other parts of the government studying guns and violence. There has been no lack of studies.

Theoretically, the CDC _can_ still do "gun violence research" it's just any published finding that would tend recommend violating civil and human rights to in response to "gun violence" would have it's funding pulled.  Rather than funding research that might lead to other, legally permissible, methods to address "gun violence" the CDC opted to do nothing.

It's a similar situation to the old Violence Against Women Act funding stipulations where if you researched domestic abuse or sexual violence and published results that did not support approaching these problems from the "women are victims; men are perpetrators" you'd no longer qualify for further funding since you weren't researching a problem that primarily affected women.

Studies may lead to us deciding to grant the government authority to do something it does not do now. This happened with tobacco use, the environment and the EPA in the 70's . though there are arguments over how that granting of authority was done, and what has been done with it since, the research behind the detrimental effects of pollution, and tobacco use, are sound.

The problem is when the research is created to achieve a predetermined outcome, as was being done by the CDC at the time.

Again, apples and oranges.  BTW, I'm not criticizing the decision to turn the Jewish immigrants away.  It was a decision made informed by information available to the leadership at that time.  They were just as intelligent as you or I are, but they just didn't have your 20/20 hindsight.

Another problem historians have with "what if'ing" the past is that the more you study history, the more you see how interdependent different actions are.  For example, you can't just say that killing Hitler as a child would've made the world a better place today because there is a distinct possibility that WWII resulted in the best possible world today.

People have been facing and fleeing genocide since time began.  The choice to admit or deny these populations has been a mixed bag of good and bad outcomes for both populations.  C) The approval process is incidental.

I would caution you to compare two "similar", but unique situations.  Allow history to inform current decisions, but using one "what if" as the basis for a current policy decision is a failure in due diligence.

Kind of like how Donald Trump yesterday didn't actually say a national Muslim tracking database should happen because clearly he was talking about building the wall, and the reporter changed the subject on him and he didn't hear it because his response on that it "Certainly needs to happen" and the reported said "why?" and he says, "Because it will stop illegal immigration" seems evidence that he was not answering some question on Muslim surveillance.  I mean he had just said, "We are going to build the wall."

But buy has the media had their heyday.  You think these people don't know what Trump actually was talking about?  Do you think these people don't know that Rubio isn't saying to shut down Mosques or any place of worship for Muslims here?

No, they know, it's just 100% pure and biased reporting, trying to make a scandal out of nothing.  It is completely dishonest, and imo, unethical that journalists are doing it.  Yes, Fox does it to the left, and here, TP does it to the right.

But wow, so many here are feeding into this media concoction... and that is why it is never going to change.  Too many people just eat up what the news media says as long as it fits the narrative of their pre-conceived opinions.</Comment><Comment author="philnotfil" date="1448070462.0" date_utc="1448041662.0" id="cx73h03" parent_id="t3_3tl3rw" type="comment">&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</Comment><Comment author="sleaze_bag_alert" date="1448074253.0" date_utc="1448045453.0" id="cx7601q" parent_id="t3_3tl3rw" type="comment">Guess they have to close the Starbucks on rt 7 in falls church va.  /s</Comment><Comment author="Tolve" date="1448082306.0" date_utc="1448053506.0" id="cx7b8ds" parent_id="t3_3tl3rw" type="comment">By the time this campaign ends, Trump will be encouraging Christians to suicide bomb mosques, and he'll be the Republican nominee.</Comment><Comment author="MrNature72" date="1448094876.0" date_utc="1448066076.0" id="cx7iad1" parent_id="t1_cx7b8ds" type="reply">Do you really believe this?</Comment><Comment author="Tolve" date="1448095471.0" date_utc="1448066671.0" id="cx7il31" parent_id="t1_cx7iad1" type="reply">The second part.

They will bring up every skeleton in her closet as much as possible if she's elected. Not unlike what they've been doing to Obama for years. Clinton even said herself that she's proud Republicans are her enemies in the first debate.  If you think they're going to magically work together for a better future of mankind, well... That's not how things work right now. Sure, they might hate on Bernie, but he's clean and honest. There is nothing to dig up and throw at him and he can rally a lot of people for a purpose to back him up on subjects. 

I have a feeling that if Hillary were to get elected, she'd fight her fights alone without the American people. Which means nothing will get done except for war. Especially if you research how Republicans see her. This part, I'll agree with Republicans in the question of how can she have a stake for presidency in the middle of a huge scandal she's being investigated for? Nixon had a huge scandal and was impeached for it. So what I think the Republicans will focus on the entire time if Clinton is President would be getting her impeached.</Comment><Comment author="RoastBeefOnChimp" date="1448139640.0" date_utc="1448110840.0" id="cx7xak5" parent_id="t1_cx726zq" type="reply">They hate anyone who is not them.

Once inside, the answer to who can work to get things done despite ridiculous pressure lies in the history of the candidates and their plans to use that history as President.
I don't want this to turn into a 'who got the most things past' contest, so I'm going to say that I side with the candidate that is using the power of the American people to help get things done. A candidate with the energy to rile up everyone to get involved in politics.

That's too high. Also, he's not taxing us that, he's taxing the rich. 
O'Malley even backed up Bernie saying his 70% tax on the rich showed that the idea works well. (Latest debate) On top of that, any new taxes he could have for us are actually from programs redistributed in a smarter way, like the single payer system costing all of the nation far less money but taxed merely the same. 
Let's add to that the minimum wage raise he wants to make, so that gives us quite a bit more money to use to help pay for the changes. (Helps those who are earning very low wages) Lastly, before you say it, colleges will be paid by taxing Wallstreet, not us. When it comes to States helping pay for education (us), again, it's a redistributed bill so we won't be paying much of any bit higher than we are now for education.

Let's not forget that currently, a billion dollar corporation that knows how to stash away it's money is paying taxes far less than a trucker or waitress. 10% to the rich is very different from 10% to the poor. (and they're paying even lower than that. Some actually get money back from the government instead) You know very well more could be done to fix this and get even greater amounts of money flowing to help fix the economy. 

When it comes to fixing the debt that we're in, we'll have to stabilize our economy first until it starts earning again. Otherwise paying up front for it would destabilize things yet again for us. The main reason why it's taking more money to fix money is because of corruption, wealth rising mostly to the 1/10th of 1 percent, inflation, and bad economic decisions. Once these things are fixed, the economy will start getting much better.</Comment><Comment author="neurn2" date="1448099637.0" date_utc="1448070837.0" id="cx7km3v" parent_id="t1_cx7i6c7" type="reply">Oh you think the truth matters when it comes to attacks from the party of death panels and birtherism.

The job of the Supreme Court is to interpret the constitution and lay out what it means. It's well and good that you interpret it one way, a way that I agree with, but then take that on a larger scale and it becomes a problem. That's why the govt is set up the way it is, to prevent overall mob rule.

It may not match up with my interpretation of the constitution, but the Supreme Court has the final say on how government interprets something. After that, we can change that on a state by state basis on a smaller scale mob rule.</Comment><Comment author="AnUnoriginalName123" date="1448083691.0" date_utc="1448054891.0" id="cx7c3iq" parent_id="t1_cx7bp4g" type="reply">It is the job of the court to interpret the constitution, but that does not mean that the court can not be wrong. There are many instances where the SCOTUS said things were constitutional that obviously were not and vice versa, so I don't think it is rational for us to tell people that their opinion should not be expressed until the court expresses or that their opinion is invalid and false by default because of the courts ruling is counter productive since we indirectly decide who is and is not on the court via voting for the President and our senators. 


PS: Mob rule is a dysphemism for the majority of people getting what they want from the government. We too often forget that the American Revolution was the colonial elite ousting the British elite and setting up a Republic where only a small minority (about 6% of the population) could actually participate in government and that the founding fathers used this term to justify blatantly aristocratic and undemocratic government structures that favored their interests.</Comment><Comment author="Xerazal" date="1448087718.0" date_utc="1448058918.0" id="cx7ehva" parent_id="t1_cx7c3iq" type="reply">I never said scotus can't be wrong, just that they're doing their job.

Supreme Court ruled the legislature's budget was unconstitutional because the Kansas state constitution says they have to fund schooling, and the court said they weren't doing that adaquately.  So then the Legislature passed a law saying they would get to pick district court judges instead of Supreme Court.   Courts said they would strike down that law, so the legislature added a clause saying that if they courts overturned it, the courts would be completely defunded.   Now the legislature is arguing that every member of the Supreme Court should recuse themselves from the case.   They have a constitutional crisis in Kansas because the legislature doesn't want to follow their own constitution.  </Comment><Comment author="rosencrat" date="1448099059.0" date_utc="1448070259.0" id="cx7kc8m" parent_id="t1_cx79lq8" type="reply">And these legislators just got an 8.5% "automatic" raise.    </Comment><Comment author="cincycusefan" date="1448090355.0" date_utc="1448061555.0" id="cx7fyf6" parent_id="t1_cx79lq8" type="reply">I'm surprised that this issue was brought in the state courts at all.

Yea, [he didn't suggest it](http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/19/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-threat-to-country/)...

&gt; Donald Trump on Thursday called for the creation of a national database to register all Muslims living in the U.S. to protect the country against terrorism.

&gt;**"I would certainly implement that. Absolutely,"** Trump told NBC News during a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa.

&gt;He continued: **"There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems."**

Is this the political campaigns you want?  Anybody can make up a lie, let the other side (left or right) eat it up and circulate it like it is the gospel, and it is up to the candidate to "clarify" the lie?

Casting the aspersion on me is pretty pointless. 

I just find it odd, given Trump's propensity for calling out his detractors. He could easily slap the MSM, say "Fuck you guys, you got it wrong" and win the day.

As far as what I want for clarity - I think a pretty simple: "Yes I want to set up databases to track Muslims" or "No, I was discussing walls and you dipshits got it wrong" would suffice.

&gt;Bowers&#8217; invocation of the World War II-era camps in which thousands of Japanese and Japanese-Americans were imprisoned triggered stern rebukes from fellow council members, **Democratic** and Republican leaders and **Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign.**

&gt;Bowers, a Democrat, broke with his party &#8212; including Gov. Terry McAuliffe &#8212; on the refugee question

&gt;State Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker issued a statement to &#8220;strongly condemn&#8221; the mayor&#8217;s remarks. &#8220;To suggest any policy similar to one of our darkest moments for human rights would send a wrong message to our country and the world,&#8221; Swecker said.

The reporter specifically followed him and asked for clarification on a Muslim database, and asked him repeatedly how that would be any difference between that and a Jewish registry from the Nazis.

Trump made some vague *"What do you think?"* remarks.

That's Trumps fault.

The reporter gave him the opportunity to clarify or outright deny any such thing, multiple times.

If its a trap, then the person who set it ASKED the prey multiple times before he trapped him.

The reason why Donald Trump keeps it vague is because he knows the Xenophobic 30% of Republican voters  keeping him at the top of polls love hearing stuff like that.

What you don't understand is that the question comparing his registry to the Nazi registry is the perfect opportunity for him to acquit himself of such a comparison.

He didn't do it, that's his own fault. He could've ended it right there.

I don't really care what your standards are for a "formal interview" questions are questions. The press is the one asking those questions, and Donald knew he was talking to the press, and he even asked the report what press outlet he was with. The reporter said "NBC News."

Anything he POORLY communicates afterwards is his own fault. 

I didn't know that the only words that matter are ones given in formal interviews. That's news to me.

Of course after 9/11, this all changed in no small part due to our government's reactions.  If instead of invading Iraq and Afghanistan, we had come to blows with Saudi Arabia on the clear information that nearly all the perpetrators were Saudi and the likelihood that the royal family had some knowledge, the anti-Muslim sentiment may have never taken hold the way it has.

Now there is nearly 15 years worth of momentum behind the demagoguery, with people who are now adults who have no memory of 9/11 having been taught how to feel towards Muslims.

Yea it was great to make more money, but a minimum wage job is not a career and I can only imagine how much damage doubling the wages will hurt small businesses (the ones that really matter).

Minimum wage jobs may not be 'careers' but they are lifetime positions for millions of people, and not to any fault of their own. According to the Department of Labor 89% of those benefiting from an increase in the federal minimum wage are over 20 years old. Its not physically possible for everyone to have a cushy desk job, so why shouldn't the people that essentially prop up our economy not be given a living wage? Ethics aside, the largest cost of labor isn't wages, its benefits. Doubling the wage doesn't double labor costs unless of course your company never payed benefits in the first place, which is a business model I hope we would not aim to defend. Increase in labor cost doesn't translate 1:1 to increase of prices either. In the most severe of estimates, every $1 increase in wages, returns an $0.25 increase in cost of goods. An increase in wages sharply decreases employee turnover as well which is a huge cost to the employer and a distraction from the real work that needs to be done. Furthermore, an increase in wages, increases disposable and discretionary income, which when given to the poorest of earners goes directly into the marketplace, stimulating the economy and in the vast majority of cases goes right back into the small businesses that you claim would be destroyed by such a change. </Comment><Comment author="timesnever" date="1448079723.0" date_utc="1448050923.0" id="cx79kqp" parent_id="t1_cx74e3e" type="reply">That's not how it's changed.

The biggest difference is that no one is currently proposing a federal $15 minimum wage right now.

Something in the $10 to $12 range, *right now* probably makes sense to most people because if the federal minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, that's about where we'd be right now. But it's unlikely anyone would increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 overnight, it'll likely take years to phase in a 66% increase.

So, the question is, if we target $12, which is where many people think it should be *right now* how will we feel by the time we finally get to $12. It could easily take 3 to 5 years to get there. In 2021, do you think that $12 will be a good place to set the federal minimum wage?

That's a much more difficult question to answer, but I suspect that most people who support a minimum wage in the $10-12 range now would probably also support the minimum wage eventually getting to $15 in the next 5 years or so. And that's roughly what Sanders is proposing. 

The poll didn't ask *that* question, so it's tough to draw any concrete conclusions about what most american voters think about.</Comment><Comment author="Anti_Bullshit" date="1448069183.0" date_utc="1448040383.0" id="cx72msm" parent_id="t3_3tl3sd" type="comment">&gt;from Aqua-Tech via /r/politics/ sent

12 is logical because it is close to what someone who was frugal could call a living wage and isn't far from where wages are going naturally. A lot of jobs that used to be minimum wage are going up from $7.25, for example Target is starting beginner retail workers at $9 these days. Making it $12 would just make sure people got a boost  but still within the realm of reason.

$15 right away cuts into the territory of what entry level professional or skilled/educated jobs pay. Those jobs would in turn have to rise a lot to attract people, and that might be bad news when IT and back office jobs that are notoriously vulnerable to outsourcing these days.

What we're talking about is a distortion in the popularity of a 15/hr minimum wage. It's more popular than a 12, but more people would be willing to accept the 12 because no one's going to take nothing over something. Here's a chart...

|-------------|------------------|

Each dash is 2% making the total 62%. The first group is the people that *only* want a 12 / hr rate. The second is the number of people that want a 15 / hr rate. Which one is bigger? That's right, the second group.

The increased minimum wage would drive up your wages as well.

No, I think that market forces naturally force them to raise wages, or else lose out employees to other businesses or business sectors which offer a better value to them. And if they lose out on employees, that means they have to raise their wages to attract new ones.</Comment><Comment author="ThirdHuman" date="1448106188.0" date_utc="1448077388.0" id="cx7nmzf" parent_id="t1_cx7ax1z" type="reply">That would certainly be the case if budgets were infinite.  
Sadly, we don't live in that world.

I can speak personally that as the owner of a non-profit, I would not only not be able to raise everyone's wages, but I would have to take a hard look at letting some of my employees go.  There is important work that my organizations does, and maximizing the number of employees would prevent that in my own situation.

Think about it, if every government, business, non-profit, or whatever were capable of not only raising wages for not only the lowest earner, but everyone else accordingly, then you have to ask where was that relocated money going to to begin with?  Perhaps there are more productive functions for organizations than can be gained with more labor.  In these specific cases, some employees are going to have to be let go.

Well, primarily, to a small fraction of the wealthiest people.

The big corporations can deal with these sorts of regulation, but smaller firms and non-profits cannot.

Big corporations have excess profits, but many small businesses and non-profits are struggling to barely scraping by.  They can't just raise their prices because they are competing for customers with specific budgets.  My friend owns a high price restaurant with extremely low profit margins.  If he has to raise prices, then he will almost certainly lose costumers to cheaper options.  This might run him out of business entirely.

To complicate matters even further, manufacturing businesses may simply be forced to buy materials from foreign countries where the cost is lower in order to compete on the global market.  Failure to do so would result in going out of business.  This will hurt American supply chains that otherwise would have been totally viable to do within the country.

In my case as a non-profit this problem is EVEN worse. I can't simply demand that my donors give me more money because the government raised my costs.  I will have to look seriously at cutting staff.</Comment><Comment author="NonHomogenized" date="1448108686.0" date_utc="1448079886.0" id="cx7ophw" parent_id="t1_cx7omm4" type="reply">&gt;  They can't just raise their prices because they are competing for customers with specific budgets.

No, because *everyone* faces the higher labor cost. *Everyone* has to raise prices. Hence my statement:

Let's say a day's labor costs $100. And out of the total revenue (in other words, the price of the product) only 10% of revenue is spent on labor currently. So the business could double wages, to $200 per day, and would need to raise the price of the product by only 10%. The price would then only be 110% of its original value. </Comment><Comment author="felizcheese" date="1448068918.0" date_utc="1448040118.0" id="cx72giw" parent_id="t3_3tl3sd" type="comment">PPP = Hillary camp</Comment><Comment author="_supernovasky_" date="1448069667.0" date_utc="1448040867.0" id="cx72y6a" parent_id="t1_cx72giw" type="reply">PPP has always been a damn good pollster.

America deserves a lot of the negative press it  earns but I like to think that at the end of the day,  everyone of us is *disgusted* by a person being beheaded or a child soldier. </Comment><Comment author="Dennysaurus539" date="1448085947.0" date_utc="1448057147.0" id="cx7dgoa" parent_id="t1_cx79e4v" type="reply">Consider this...Islam was founded 600 years after Christianity. 600 years ago Christians were burning witches. 

Now, of course, this isn't a good comparison because overall human philosophy and the world we luv in has changed, but it might present some ideas about religious evolution.

More importantly, in my opinion, is the fact that Islam used to be the bastion of knowledge, architecture, art, etc. However, Western conflicts ruined the Middle East and tribal, fundamentalist Islam was able to gain influence. It isn't purely Islam's fault for the situation at the moment, and moderates outside of the Middle East can't have much impact.

After all that is what they are supposed to do and that is how they will get re-elected. But when the choice is between doing something that is right, like voting against the so called SAFE act, and doing something that reflects the views of your constituents, leadership is required and the representative needs to do the right thing. 

In this case taking the high moral ground versus doing what is politically expedient is the right thing to do.  With proper leadership and the fact that most constituents have short memories, perhaps the representative can survive the decision.  Of course in this age of unlimited funding and national SuperPACs funding opposition candidates, this may be easier said than done. </Comment><Comment author="LebirtandJuztiz" date="1448111586.0" date_utc="1448082786.0" id="cx7pwa2" parent_id="t1_cx7nxhl" type="reply">I wished my Representative Kyrsten Sinema (Arizona 9th District, Scottsdale/ Phoenix suburbs) feared the lurking NRA armed domestic terrorists as much as she fears imaginary ones.</Comment><Comment author="Poseiden9221" date="1448110262.0" date_utc="1448081462.0" id="cx7pd4p" parent_id="t3_3tni5v" type="comment">In other words, a bunch of millennials on twitter bitching about people they've never heard of on causes they just learned about.

And if this whole thing is about Trump being misunderstood, he's had plenty of chances already to just flat out say "I don't want a Muslim database."

CAIR is a front organization for islamic radicals to spread the ideology. They are associated with the muslim brotherhood, saudi wahabbists, etc.

Fact is our country has a long history of welcoming refugees and we didn't get where we are by not doing that.

&gt; I would bomb the sh*t out of them ... I would just bomb those suckers. And that's right, I'd blow up the pipes. I'd blow up the refineries. I'd blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left, and you know what, you'll get Exxon to come in there, and in two months, you ever see these guys how good they are, the great oil companies? They'll rebuild that sucker brand new. It will be beautiful, and I'll take the oil. And I said I'll take the oil.

He also said that he would erect walls around these refineries and then we'd "have oil forever". If I find the segment of the video I'll be sure to add it. 

edit: I added the video. He goes off on a tangent for a minute or so then keeps talking about it. He also argues that it would take away money from ISIS, which is obviously a good thing. The way he wants to do it however is dangerous because Great Britain has a vested interest in middle eastern oil. If we take it and hoard it all for ourselves then I personally think that's asking for trouble. </Comment><Comment author="fitzroy95" date="1448112561.0" date_utc="1448083761.0" id="cx7qaej" parent_id="t1_cx7pvwb" type="reply">now if only we could stop creating more terrorists than we manage to destroy....</Comment><Comment author="zzz11" date="1448116557.0" date_utc="1448087757.0" id="cx7rq9d" parent_id="t1_cx7qaej" type="reply">I hear you saying, "we need way more drones to destroy all these terrorists."</Comment><Comment author="fitzroy95" date="1448131341.0" date_utc="1448102541.0" id="cx7vf86" parent_id="t1_cx7rq9d" type="reply">I'm pretty sure you have a hearing impediment.

For example, do we need any more F-35 jets? Do we need more tanks? Do we really need another aircraft carrier? No! We have more than enough already, and many of them just go to waste. 

Sure, jobs are created within the US regarding the creation of those stockpiles, but money is grossly overspent. It is the equivalent to having a military contract to build the world's tallest hotel and casino... in the middle of Death Valley. People would be contracted to build it, it would technically be infrastructure that can't be outsourced, yet would be something that would lay dormant, never to be practically used. 

Why not appropriate all of those massive funding blunders towards improving our infrastructure where it is needed instead? I'm talking about expanding things like the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard. Have that money go towards infrastructure that not only would be used, but is also drastically needed!</Comment><Comment author="4chinisbetterkek" date="1448115592.0" date_utc="1448086792.0" id="cx7req1" parent_id="t1_cx7r984" type="reply">Certainly money is misspent, and oftentimes this is due to laws passed mandating certain spending on projects the military doesn't even want. In my opinion, simply cutting spending isn't necessarily the way to go about this, but a discussion definitely needs to be had.The way to go, in my opinion, is to restructure the way we budget. Rather than establishing a system where spending more = higher budget, we need to develop analytical approaches to our appropriation of funds to the military, and from there, any cuts that are due would follow. We also shouldn't be tying military salaries to the budget necessarily, instead establishing legally mandated salaries derived from our analytical approach. 

This is of course idealist in its own right, and probably not even likely to be implementable, but I think we should be proposing more comprehensive solutions than simply cutting spending altogether.</Comment><Comment author="cd411" date="1448144607.0" date_utc="1448115807.0" id="cx7yx3u" parent_id="t1_cx7pq6i" type="reply">&gt; I simply can't comprehend the mental acrobatics that someone would have to go through to want to increase this amount.

If you have misgivings about the US letting in refugees, period... Then I disagree on a couple different grounds and that's that. It's all good.


If you are actually worried that letting refugees into the country is a threat to national security, you're working off some flat-out incorrect information. There are all kinds of WAY WAY easier ways to get into the country. People going through the US refugee program are better known to our government than you or I.

&gt;The screening process generally includes multiple interviews, background checks and an extensive cross-referencing process that tests refugee's stories against others and accounts from sources on the ground in their home country.

Okay, send troops immediately, I'm with you on that: I just googled "ground troops in Syria" and it turns out Obama sent in ground troops on the night before Halloween... So like 3 weeks ago... Does that count?

&gt; why import them AND invade them

1) getting rid of civilians makes it easier to kill hostiles &amp; Everytime we accidentally kill civilians in drone strikes etc it helps ISIS propaganda, radicalizes more people and gives USA bad press

2) taking away potential recruits means we will ultimately have fewer enemy combatants

I believe it, But if their objective is reconnaissance it would be better than nothing. I tried a quick googling &amp; everything says he opposes more ground troops.. His excuse has *some* merit to it, though: &#8220;Let&#8217;s assume we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there is a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there or Libya perhaps?&#8221;"

He also seems to be uninspiringly saying "we don't have a true solution" which feeds into my thought that the 50 troops are scouting.

I was watching the late show a few nights back &amp; a high ranking officer was saying to be effective there needs to be ~250,000 troops over there... Which if that's cumulative with a coalition at least Obama has some rationale with the 50,000 figure. I have seen repubs call for "more" but the only specific figure I saw came from McCain asking for 10,000... Which sounds ridiculously low relative to what the military officer was saying.

&gt;  Obama doesn't have the leadership or social skills to get anything done

Well Obama couldn't even find a good company to make his website, so I'm not arguing that too hard but republicans complain all the time about things he has accomplished so he can't simultaneously be getting nothing done.

&gt; It doesn't matter what ISIS wants or doesn't want.

I don't believe that you actually believe that. ISIS wants death to America &amp; if that "want" didn't matter then we wouldn't need a war.

&gt; We're not going to be able to rebuild the area either, if we liquidate the entire population.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. I personally have no interest in the "rebuilding," but liquidating the population can be interpreted in 2 very different ways... &amp; I'm not sure how either fits into the discussion.

&gt; Dems just want their free votes so it is not an issue to them.

There's a right way and a wrong way to seek justice.  They've chosen to pursue the wrong path and it is damaging their cause far more than it is helping it.

Do you honestly think that Dr. King would have achieved what he did by pursuing this path?  Hardly; he would have gained no traction either.  If the black community wants to see real change, they'll only find it by fully informing themselves on the issues, becoming actively involved in politics and, most importantly, VOTING in every single primary and election.  It's the only way they'll be listened to by most politicians.

Take a hard look at the black community's election participation stats and support for the wrong candidates.  Then, consider who the black community intends to support in the Democratic party for the upcoming election if you want to know why nothing has improved or will for it.  Most of that community has refused to support the one politician who truly understands what needs to be done to help everyone (i.e., Sanders).  Instead, it has thrown its support behind the Democratic candidate who's least likely to pursue meaningful socio-economic reforms that would benefit the community (i.e., Hillary Clinton).  Listen to what Cornel West has to say about Sanders and, most importantly, WHY he supports his candidacy.  Cornel gets it.</Comment><Comment author="jpe77" date="1448107328.0" date_utc="1448078528.0" id="cx7o4x6" parent_id="t3_3tnjam" type="comment">I've voted straight Democratic Party for 20 years.

* States with large poor population that heavily rely on welfare and government aid have been electing Republicans who want to reduce or eliminate such programs (governor of Maine and Kentucky)

* More downward disdain than upward resentment: Those who vote and are in the middle class or lower are more sensitive to their lower counterparts misusing the welfare system than the inequality present between their higher counterparts.

&gt;One way to [reduce the resentment] this is to make sure the programs are as tightly administered as possible. Instances of fraud and abuse are far rarer than welfare opponents would have one believe, but it only takes a few glaring instances to create a lasting impression...

&gt;The best way to reduce resentment, though, would be to bring about true economic growth in the areas where the use of government benefits is on the rise...

* Poor people simply do not vote either out of ignorance, stricter voting rules, or both. 

&gt;...it means redoubling efforts to mobilize the people who benefit from the programs. This is no easy task with the rural poor, who are much more geographically scattered than their urban counterparts.  

TLDR: People need to vote and contrast against the more wealthy than the more poor. </Comment><Comment author="donsanedrin" date="1448107171.0" date_utc="1448078371.0" id="cx7o2ey" parent_id="t3_3tmn0k" type="comment">Its a great article, and for some people they may view it as a compelling case for the "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" crowd.

But this largely confirms the phrase "trained to hate downwards."

I'll never realize why people, who have been unemployed before during their life, seemingly lose all memories and feelings related to what it felt like being unemployed and looking for work, walking into a building you've never been before, to see people you don't know. With a sense that everybody is staring at and judging you.

Heaven forbid that you go to Walmart and checkout your groceries, and when you swipe your EBT card, you may have smile on your face. Heaven forbid that somebody sees you smiling at all. Right?

The article started off explaining the story of a lady who was going to a dialysis clinic, and she was judging other people who were going to the dialysis clinic. She must have some sixth sense to determine which people suffering from kidney failure are bums, and which ones are not.</Comment><Comment author="pheisenberg" date="1448146506.0" date_utc="1448117706.0" id="cx7znjw" parent_id="t1_cx7o2ey" type="reply">&gt; I'll never realize why people, who have been unemployed before during their life, seemingly lose all memories and feelings related to what it felt like

I can think of a few reasons. One is that once you've improved your situation, you may expect never to go back. Another is not thinking about the past out of shame. Or thinking that you are not like the other unemployed people, you were different and more deserving all along.

What's notable to me is that the quoted reasons for opposing welfare are emotions arising out of cultural norms, such as 

&gt; "When you&#8217;re getting assistance, there should be hoops to jump through so that you&#8217;re paying a price for your behavior."

OK, 99% of people aren't policy wonks. But, are those attitudes functional, or were they adapted to a now-gone society? It sounds like individually, the "pull yourself up" attitude helps motivate people to do better, especially in a discouraging environment.

So I'm willing to grant there may be a lot of logic to the position of the middle-income republican voter. On the other hand, the article is about entire areas and towns that are not doing well. Individual effort is not going to save towns declining because of global macroeconomics. The article ends on a related note:

&gt; The best way to reduce resentment, though, would be to bring about true economic growth in the areas where the use of government benefits is on the rise,

But how? It sounds like these areas don't produce much value and aren't in a good bidding position. Narrowly economic self-interest might be best served not by voting democratic, but by getting as much education as possible, then leaving.</Comment><Comment author="CarsonOrSanders" date="1448091507.0" date_utc="1448062707.0" id="cx7gk9r" parent_id="t3_3tmn0k" type="comment">Awesome!

Really? This sentence begs to differ:

&gt;The people in these communities who are voting Republican **in larger proportions** are those who are a notch or two up the economic ladder

So, yes, the "rich" people are voting Republican more often than the "poor", but that's a far cry from claiming that the "poor" are either not voting at all or are voting Democrat.

There are entire counties where the vast majority of people are "poor" yet still vote Republican.

Rather, they are not voting, period.

&gt;NBC: Is that something your White House would like to do?

&gt;TRUMP: I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.


If he is not advocating compelling American muslims to register with a federal database he needs to clarify immediately. That policy is not remotely tolerable or constitutional.</Comment><Comment author="BigDiggerNick74" date="1448146816.0" date_utc="1448118016.0" id="cx7zs67" parent_id="t1_cx6zxam" type="reply">&gt;Can you explain what he meant by this

Sure. Just read the part that you conveniently cut off:
&gt;Reporter: But that&#8217;s something your White House would like to implement?

&gt;Trump: Oh, I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.

&gt;Reporter: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work?

&gt;Trump: It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.

Multiple insurance companies require every healthcare provider to spend significant portions of time doing administration and paperwork, hence reducing the time available to actually work with patients.

Single payer has no middle man, has massively reduced administration costs, has a consistent way of billing for all services (which helps that administration), and ensures that the single payer is large enough to ensure the best possible price from pharmacy suppliers.</Comment><Comment author="BalaaClaava" date="1448106285.0" date_utc="1448077485.0" id="cx7noig" parent_id="t1_cx7mmdv" type="reply">LOL

In HC there are only 2 ways to increase profits, cut care or increase premiums. Up until the ACA insurance companies could increase profits by simply denying care and jacking up rates at the same time. Now that the ACA is law, they have to justify rate increases (while adhering to the formula that 85% of all premium dollars must go toward patient care) and provide care to everyone (i.e. They can't deny care to people with pre existing conditions). So this is cutting into their ridiculous profit model. UHC has profits of  near $36B in 2014. 

Imagine if ran a non profit model while having the purchasing power to negotiate down pricing because everyone had to deal with a single entity rather than a fragmented system? How much better care or reduced costs could $36B buy?</Comment><Comment author="BustergunFIRE" date="1448103627.0" date_utc="1448074827.0" id="cx7mh8u" parent_id="t1_cx7lfye" type="reply">&gt;What are the primary drivers behind the high cost of health care

We do a lot of integration with different payers (insurance companies).  

The Cost of Healthcare, from a government perspective and from an insurance perspective is not the same for a healthcare provider.  

An example, say I have to have an MRI done.  The cost of the MRI machine, is depreciated over 7 years, and the accountants estimate that this machine will do X number of MRI's a year.  So they divide that cost of the machine by 7 and by the X number of MRI's a year.  This process goes on... and on.... add in the Rad tech's time, the costs of a team of Radiologist and the hospital staff to support them, admin over head, IT software and hardware to support them and keep all those MRI (and other) images around for several decades.

This Cost of this procedure is what it costs the Hospital itself it do the MRI.  (Usually, by monthly, all the costs that dept incurred divided by the procedures they did, will end up with a pretty good estimate)  Say it comes to $3000.  The hospital then bill's the insurance company $5000.  That insurance company will pay only 2500.  That's a netloss of $2000.  They can bill the patient say $1000 (20% of the original 5K)..... but if the patient has met their out of pocket expenses.... they won't have to pay it, due to contracts w/ the insurance company.  There's a lot of that I don't understand in the ways of how the money is shared between the payers and providers.

One of the variables in this whole mess is the X number of procedures done.  For a hospital, admission rates are everything.  How many beds are occupied... more beds means more procedures.  There's a downward trend in the last several years of admission rates.  Less procedures are being done.  Which, the hospital must spread the costs between less and less people.  Which in turn; makes the costs go up.

Now.... in an effort to turn this around, there are new(ish) things are coming into the board.  Accountable Care Organizations, Medicare Shared Savings Programs, etc.  I don't know a lot about these -- but what I know thus far is Organization is going to be paid to keep patient's well...... instead of being paid for services.   So a lot of attention is going to be made for preventative care in the near future.  From what I understand it's the next 'grand' experiement..... we'll see how well it plays out.

The giant douche was a giant douche, but if he had been elected, we wouldn't be in nearly as much debt. The Bush tax cuts never would have been a thing.

This is a serious question. Look at [her website's write up of her foreign policy plan:](http://www.jill2016.com/plan)

End the wars and drone attacks, cut military spending by at least 50% and close the 700+ foreign military bases that are turning our republic into a bankrupt empire. Stop U.S. support and arms sales to human rights abusers, and lead on global nuclear disarmament.

Yes, some of them are "we're already doing that" but cutting military spending by 50%, ending drone attacks, stopping sales to several of our favorite countries in the middle easy (S.A. looking at you first buddy) would be major steps forwards in our foreign policy in my opinion.

America creates more problems for the world and for itself when they intervene in regional conflict and sectarian conflicts. I'm very much in favor of not putting in resources towards anything that does not provide benefit greater than the resources put into it.

While aggressive posturing by China is something to be worried about, it's not our fight alone, fight these with tariffs from a collaboration of nations, not with military posturing.</Comment><Comment author="MalkaMania" date="1448085278.0" date_utc="1448056478.0" id="cx7d2cm" parent_id="t1_cx78wny" type="reply">We can't simply cut funding by 50%.

So take it with a grain of salt if you don't agree. 

But I really don't see any of Bernie's truly progressive ideas feasible in the current political claimant.  Neither single payer healthcare, nor free college are really a possibility with the state of our congress. 

I'd rather have more small victories under a democratic president who doesn't aim too high and ruin any chance of cooperation. Obama has showed that even in a republican dominated congress we can make small victories. As of now, I am just as excited for Hillary as I was for Obama. And I personally think that after her presidency she will have made the U.S. a better place for a significant portion of the middle class, that wouldn't happen under an obstructionist president like Bernie.

If we want to elect a progressive like Sanders this is not the election to do so. Someone who is significantly left of the Demeocratic party has little chance to get things done with the current state of the congress. 

However, in 2020 we will have a census, and a redistricting during a presidential election, which all demographic trends point to helping the Democrats significantly.

The crux of this argument is that Clinton, vehemently hated by Republicans can do more. I don't think so. If there's anything she would have a chance of getting them to work with her on it would be to screw Americans with the TPP, SOPA, or any number of other awful programs.
    
But Obama's term proved that Republicans would drop their own ideas and run further right whenever Obama agreed so I think even that scenario is unlikely.
    
So if we're going to have a congress who wants nothing to get done, I want the person on the job who's going to fight the hardest. Furthermore Sanders could boost turnout and help sway congress. This is what I see as a reality.

So Sanders wouldn't be truly progressive because the Republicans said no? He would still be in command of foreign policy, executive orders, cabinet and agency positions, and have the bully pulpit to speak from.

I think this is fairly obvious for anyone who follows what legislature gets passed by congress. Obama is even more vehemently hated than Clinton, Christie dropped what 10 points in the polls for hugging him? Yet he was able to be decently effective, because he polls weren't so far left as to be impassible in the current political climate. Things like free college or a SP healthcare system are.

Are you really telling me that you wouldn't have four more years of Obama's small steps than 4 years of obstructionism and stagnation?

&gt; So Sanders wouldn't be truly progressive because the Republicans said no? He would still be in command of foreign policy, executive orders, cabinet and agency positions, and have the bully pulpit to speak from. 

Yes! 

His foreign policy isn't significantly different from Hillary, and he comes off as totally inept in the subject anyways. 

He can't accomplish any of his promises through executive orders, all of them are tied to the power to tax, thus congress. 

&gt;  I see him as the true and realistic solution to our problems

Than you are delusional. Did you not see how hard it was for Obama to pass his current budget which is in line with Clinton's proposals. Starting 3x from the current budget just invites Republican obstructionism. </Comment><Comment author="Slapbox" date="1448115046.0" date_utc="1448086246.0" id="cx7r7ur" parent_id="t1_cx7p5qi" type="reply">I'm sorry.

Selecting a candidate based on who the Republicans would work with is the stupidest idea I've heard that isn't coming from the Republicans themselves. The Republicans aren't going to work with anyone.

The fact is Sanders has worked with Republicans on bills that passed and at the very least has the respect of John McCain. Name a single Republican who expresses respect for Clinton or an indication they might work with her?

Neither single payer healthcare, nor free college are really a possibility with the state of our congress.

I see this as a reason to vote for Sanders over Clinton.   Sanders is definitely too far left for me but Clinton I think would be worse.   I really do not trust her.

The fact that his hands would be somewhat tied is a feature of our system of checks and balances, not a bug.

We need to all remember that we're not electing a monarch with free rein (actually, free "reign" works as well in this context).

I fear Clinton will take the nomination and quite possibly the presidency.

In no time at all the Sanders Brigade will descend upon this thread and attempt to discredit the poll.

What is the Sanders Brigade, you ask? ([quoted from a previous comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3tk522/bernie_sanders_is_right_the_top_01_percent_have/cx6vua1)):

&gt;I call it **the Sanders Brigade**.
&gt;
&gt;It's basically everyone from /r/SandersForPresident, and others on reddit who support Sanders, who have decided to do the following en masse on all the major subs (like /r/politics) across reddit:
&gt;
&gt;1) Upvote all pro-Sanders posts and comments
&gt;
&gt;2) Downvote all anti-Sanders &amp; pro-Clinton posts and comments
&gt;
&gt;Point #2 also includes the results of scientific polls ([several of which are released on a weekly basis](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary)), which are newsworthy but disliked by the Brigade because Sanders' support has plateaued at around 30% nationally, and he is losing by double digits in most states. 
&gt;
&gt;Usually you can find members of the Sanders Brigade in full force within the comments section of poll posts; they typically criticize the poll's sampling methodology, say the sample size is too small, or attempt to write off the poll entirely. Their favorite term for this last part is "outlier" -- if the poll shows Sanders losing by a huge margin, it's an "outlier", which means we should just ignore it. It's the equivalent of a child putting their hands over their ears and shouting "I CAN'T HEAR YOU" repeatedly when they are faced with something they don't want to hear.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, these are the same people who, after each debate, use /r/SandersForPresident to post a list of all online debate opinion polls, so that Bernie supporters can self-select into participating and essentially brigade Bernie into the top of each poll. Then they declare Bernie the winner of the debate, "because every online poll said so!", but of course when the scientific polls (which don't allow for self-selecting, as this obviously introduces major bias into the result) are issued a few days later, Sanders' support is unchanged and Clinton remains the favorite of a majority of Democratic voters. So they accuse polling companies of being shills for Clinton, criticize the methodology, call it an outlier, etc -- the circlejerk of the Sanders Brigade continues anew.

"It's an outlier!" 

"The sample size was too small!" 

"They didn't call enough cell phones!" 

"Wait for the next debate!"

It's one thing for the Sanders Brigade to manipulate votes on reddit. It's another for them to accuse you of being a reddit troll paid for by the Clinton campaign (I've had several PMs accusing me of this), calling you stupid and un-American for your beliefs, and more.

You don't know the future.  The truth is Hillary Clinton was always the frontrunner and still is.  But that's it -- just like in 2007, things can take a sharp turn in January.  

It's too early to call, but we'll know by Super Tuesday.  I don't see why HRC supporters wouldn't welcome any kind of challenge and acknowledge it  and all the support behind it as valid.

Yet all many HRC supporters seem to do is want to write off all Sanders supporters as young/newly engaged (doesn't make their vote count any less) or largely just white liberal college aged Redditors.

Probably. I think you're confused about the term "lame duck President", which specifically refers to the time between an election and the inauguration of the newly-elected (different) President.

1) Formal Application with the U.N is submitted

-Birth certificates, IDs, passports, etc.

2) Formal proof of displacement (to the UN)

3) Submission of a formal timeline of your displacement

-Including, but not limited to: place of birth, details of family members, where they are, where you are, what you're doing at this very moment - all notarized and verified by multiple international agencies

4) Provide names of every direct family member, dead or alive with contact information. If some are dead or missing, verification of either is required to move on.

5) The next 12-18 months is spent verifying all information provided with multiple reference checks done along the way. If and ONLY IF you get to this point, you will be called for a formal interview.

7) You are then interviewed by a UN official with each living member, whether or not they're claiming refugee status, to verify your story.

8) There are verified reports that average refugee goes through this initial interview process 3+ separate times

9) Then, there is a medical scan, and another interview.

10) Then, your application is approved.

All this occurs before stepping foot on American soil.</Comment><Comment author="Ownage4you" date="1448150411.0" date_utc="1448121611.0" id="cx81epw" parent_id="t1_cx81162" type="reply">except it doesn't you just copy pasted a non-sourced twitter post. </Comment><Comment author="J0E_SpRaY" date="1448151109.0" date_utc="1448122309.0" id="cx81qr1" parent_id="t1_cx81epw" type="reply">Yes, it does.

If a reporter asks you if you are going to do something bad and you say you will you kind of forfeit the right to criticize the reporter. Trump was suggesting we were going to have to do things that were unthinkable a year ago. I guess Trump expected to be asked "what sort of unthinkable things would you do" so he could give his canned response, but instead the reporter put him in a tighter spot by asking if he will implement Nazi style tracking and identification for Muslims, AND HE SAYS YES. HE FUCKING SAYS HE WILL. It's not a bad question, it was a fucking great question and completely clarified what Trump meant by his statement.

Now personally I don't believe he would or could go this far, and that he is mainly pandering to his base. I also don't think he quite made the Nazi analogy when the reporter asked the question or he would have backed off a bit. But it's such an obvious Nazi analogy that it's kind of disgusting that he didn't make that connection.</Comment><Comment author="BebopRocksteady82" date="1448076981.0" date_utc="1448048181.0" id="cx77s8a" parent_id="t3_3tlokv" type="comment">Which was obvious to anyone with half a brain.

Besides that, they both tend towards military isolation (though Trump would hit ISIS, particularly in Iraq, which is distinct from, say, Hillary's constant hawkish calls to remove Assad and her disastrous support of the rebels there and elsewhere.) 

Both are antiestablishment candidates, and have their merits, though they don't always overlap. If one considers how they'd be constrained by Congress etc instead of just their (alleged) positions, I think they are the best likely nominees by a long shot. 

I like Sanders values but I'm skeptical of the ways he intends to implement policy. He seems a bit short sighted. Trump obviously has his flaws too, but I'm fairly confident little of it would become law. A Trump administration would very likely result in the GOP shifting a bit to the left, whereas I'm confident a Democrat president would result in a united, obstructionist GOP and tea party Republicans making more gains in the mid terms. </Comment><Comment author="SaintViolet" date="1448077919.0" date_utc="1448049119.0" id="cx78ehm" parent_id="t1_cx77s8a" type="reply">Yeah, it's a smear campaign and half the people calling him a Nazi on this sub knew it.

When you consistently say things like [this](http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/trump-suggests-unthinkable-security-response-to-isis-in-yahoo-interview/):  

&gt; &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to do things that we never did before. And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule&#8230;And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we&#8217;re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago&#8230;We&#8217;re going to have to look at the mosques. We&#8217;re going to have to look very, very carefully.&#8221;  

it leaves people wondering exactly what "unthinkable" steps you're proposing regarding Muslims. In any case, he's very clearly advocating a drastic authoritarian security response.</Comment><Comment author="rapaza" date="1448079533.0" date_utc="1448050733.0" id="cx79g87" parent_id="t3_3tlokv" type="comment">Another reporter asked him later in 2 different occasions if he really meant that and he doubled up on the same idea.

Adding names on a list and then doing little about it is worthless.  Yet that seems to be what's happening.  I don't think the loss of privacy makes us any safer.  What would make us safer if is intelligence agencies actually did their work with real leads.

They have thousands of names on a watch list, but those people aren't being tracked very well.  The intelligence failure was huge in the Paris, and it appears to be a systemic issue that isn't being addressed:

The homeless are always a concern, hence the GOP's focus on policies that create jobs, reduce lowering burdensome taxes and regulations, regulating immigration so there isn't a glut of unemployable workers, and cutting programs that encourage laziness. Most homeless don't receive welfare benefits, hence the reason they are sick, hungry, and homeless. So I don't know how you can justify accusing them of being "lazy welfare leeches". 

Also, we can't pretend to be this generous nation if we can't even take care of our own. The fact of the matter is, we need to fix our problems at home before fixing them abroad. We should be diverting resources to helping our own homeless before we begin providing for refugees. </Comment><Comment author="rapaza" date="1448086246.0" date_utc="1448057446.0" id="cx7dn0h" parent_id="t1_cx7cj34" type="reply">Trump was talking about Muslims.</Comment><Comment author="Handsome_Hunk" date="1448087810.0" date_utc="1448059010.0" id="cx7ejqv" parent_id="t1_cx7dn0h" type="reply">Any other speculation you'd like to present as fact? </Comment><Comment author="Donalds_Strumpet" date="1448097564.0" date_utc="1448068764.0" id="cx7jmj0" parent_id="t3_3tm5uf" type="comment">this article links the actual vid in another article

Actually i've been saying that if Trump stays in the race until January that he'll have alienated enough voters from the GOP that it'll be cake for the Dem candidate to win. 

The GOPs own reasearch done 3 years ago, showed that they couldn't depend on the white male over 40 vote to win in 2016. They're just dying off too quickly.  They needed to improve their standing with women voters, especially single women, by 10 points and their standing with Hispanic voters by 20 points in order to win the presidency.

Would you say the GOP has done that?
Would you say Trump's standing with women and Hispanics is better than Rmoney's was in 2012?</Comment><Comment author="TRUMPTRUMPTRUMPTRUMP" date="1448149954.0" date_utc="1448121154.0" id="cx816va" parent_id="t1_cx80kd6" type="reply">The GOP Establishment is a business clique who doesnt represent the American people. 

Trump is running against them and proving them wrong!

Trump is winning over moderates and liberals who are turned off by BORING Obama and LOW ENERGY Hillary.

"People do not vote against their immediate monetary interest." This is literally the basis of the GOP -- using social/religious wedge issues to get poor White people to vote against their economic interests.

Hillary will probably win but all it really takes is a downswing in the economy or some horrific event before the election for GOP to swing in. Elections are fickle and so are people. People vastly underestimate just how uninformed and how little attention so many voters pay.

California. Nevada. New Mexico. Florida. All enormous Hispanic populations and two with a gigantic portion of the electoral college. All went Democrat in the 2012 election. And that was 4 years ago.

Romney would have won in any other time in American history. He lost because of demographics. You *cannot beat* demographics. If the demographics keep changing, a Republican cannot ever win.

All alcohol above 3.2% can only be sold in liquor stores.  Liquor stores can only sell things that contain at least 1% alcohol (no ice, or bottle openers, non-alcohol mixers, or limes).  Liquor stores cannot use refridgeration (although some purposely use inadiquate heat in the winter).  There are a few different ballot measures in 2016 to overturn all of these silly rules.  It will be really nice.  There are some beers that simply don't handle warming very well and it changes the flavor.  3.2% beer is simply gross.  It tastes strangely sweet or weak.

From the article:  

&gt;Alaska&#8217;s finances are unlike those of any other state. It has no income tax, no statewide sales tax and among the lowest per capita tax burdens in the U.S. Instead of from taxes, its money comes overwhelmingly from two sources: oil revenue, which provides close to 90 percent of the discretionary budget, **and federal funds,** of which Alaska has historically been among the top per capita recipients....

fivethirtyeight fails to call those federal funds, tax money since they seem to admire Alaskan's refusal to pay taxes themselves.

Alaska requires more Fed employees per capita because is covered by mostly (80%+) Federal land which requires management, and Alaska has large military presence considering it's population.</Comment><Comment author="nordak" date="1448073388.0" date_utc="1448044588.0" id="cx75fef" parent_id="t1_cx70xqx" type="reply">Look at the [reference](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2014/12/federal-spending-in-the-states) in the footnotes. 

&gt; total federal spending was equivalent to about 18 percent of state GDP in fiscal 2013, **just below the national average**

And a disproportionate chunk of Federal spending in Alaska comes from the disproportionately large Military presence, and disproportionately large number of Federal employees in the State to manage the huge amount of Federal land.

No, not that hard, but I don't find this to be nearly as intriguing as the media would like me to believe. I find it a hell of a lot more intriguing that such disingenuous interpretations are being repeated all over the MSM. 

I also think this will backfire as a Trump attack, resulting in lots of sympathy from the right wing media.

Unless YOU are guaranteeing that no terrorists are posing as refugees trying to get into the US. Which I think the ISIS had said they would do even before the Paris attacks. What is wrong with being extra careful here?
Nowadays even if I like to let some homeless people into my house for the night (which I do not think regular people nowadays would do), I am certainly going to make sure they are women and children, and not some rough characters that have all kinds of knives and guns with them.

In r/K Selection Theory in Evolutionary Ecology, if you provide a population with free resources, those who will come to dominate the population will exhibit five basic traits, called an r-selected Reproductive Strategy. These traits are all designed to best exploit the free resource availability. In nature, the r-selected strategy is best seen in the rabbit, which lives in fields of grass it will never fully consume. The five traits are, competition and risk avoidance, promiscuity, low-investment single parenting, earlier age of sexualization of young, and no loyalty to in-group. These traits are ultimately designed to selfishly maximize the numbers of offspring produced. Each of these offspring, though of lesser fitness, will be able to survive and reproduce freely themselves, due to the free resource availability. In r-selection nobody ends up dead, and killing or being killed is not a concern.

In r/K Theory, there is also a strategy exactly opposite to the rabbit's, which emerges under conditions of resource scarcity. It is called the K-selected Reproductive Strategy. There, where resources are scarce, competition for resources is everywhere, and some individuals will die due to failure in competition, and the resultant resource denial that this produces. This produces the K-strategy, which is best seen in the wolf. This strategy also has five psychological traits - competitiveness/aggressiveness/protectiveness, mate monopolization/monogamy, high-investment two-parent child-rearing, later age of sexualization of young, and high loyalty to in-group. This psychology is designed to form highly fit and competitive groups that succeed in group competition, all while capturing and monopolizing the fittest mate possible, as a means of making their offspring genetically fitter than those of competitors. Here, the goal is not to simply consume as much as possible yourself and produce as many baby-making machines as you can, with little regard to their fitness. Here, the goal is to help your group succeed in its competition for the scarce resources, and then produce offspring of as high a fitness as possible, so they may carry your genes forward by succeeding in competition themselves. It is obvious why every r-strategy ideal would act as a repellent to a K-strategist, since each ideal would guarantee failure in the K-selected environment.

A concept in biology which postulates that nature will tend to produce two different psychologies, each adapted to a specific environment. It states that animals which are competitive and protective of family, sexually selective and monogamous, imbued with regard for two parent family life, desirous that offspring wait until mature to mate, and loyal to in-group are designed to produce highly fit and competitive offspring, designed to compete in an environment of resource scarcity.

Animals that exhibit a cowardly nature, promiscuous mating strategy, single parenting style, early sexualization of young, and no loyalty to in-group are designed to exploit a resource glut by producing as many offspring as possible, as fast as possible, without regard to offspring quality.

Wolves are a quintessential K-strategist species. Wolves are competitive and protective, because they must fight for food to survive. They carefully select the fittest mate, and monopolize that fit mate, so that their offspring will be as genetically fit as possible, relative to peers. They embrace two-parent family values, as offspring are reared carefully in a loving and supportive pack/family environment, so they will have the best chance of succeeding themselves in their own competitions. They do not allow offspring to mate until mature and proven in competition, so any immaturity will not lead to their offspring securing sub-par monogamous mates. Finally, they develop a strong pack-loyalty to maximize the chances of their pack's competitive success, and by extension, their own. Males evolve to be courageous and strong as they set out to provision the family and absorb any risk, while females carefully nurture offspring back at the den.

Rabbits are quintessential r-strategists. Rabbits live in fields of grass they never fully exhaust. Their goal is to produce as many offspring as quickly as possible. They flee from danger, because to fight for food that they can get elsewhere is an unnecessary risk. They mate promiscuously with any mate, because their goal is solely to reproduce, absent concerns for genetic quality - when resources are everywhere, even the most defective offspring can find food, mate, and pass genes forward. While males are off mating as often as possible, females raise offspring alone, and quickly send them on their way to whelp a new litter. Offspring begin having sex early, to maximize numbers of their own offspring. Loyalty to in-group is unknown to the rabbit, because there is no competition for resources, since resources are everywhere. Among r-strategists, males will tend to exhibit smaller, more feminine, less robust physical qualities, to better facilitate fleeing and showy displays of flash and beauty, to facilitate mate attraction, and mating. r-strategist females, by contrast will tend to grow big, assertive, and ill-tempered, to better occupy a more masculine family role, provisioning and protecting the offspring they raise alone.

Liberalism isn't intellectual. It is merely the rabbit's r-selected Reproductive Strategy, intellectualized in humans who exhibit it instinctually. Its only purpose is to exploit a resource excess in our society. This information kills Liberals, if you point it out to them, because it strips Liberalism of any intellectual justification, leaving it as merely a conglomeration of r-selected urges that K-selected humans oppose instinctually. This work is what we were waiting for, and it will alter our political debates forever.</Comment><Comment author="ukraine_not_weak" date="1448080317.0" date_utc="1448051517.0" id="cx79yk1" parent_id="t1_cx79tnz" type="reply">tl;dr</Comment><Comment author="LIBERTYRIGHT" date="1448081103.0" date_utc="1448052303.0" id="cx7agyk" parent_id="t1_cx79yk1" type="reply">Basically, it said liberals are very simple and rabbit like. </Comment><Comment author="ukraine_not_weak" date="1448081813.0" date_utc="1448053013.0" id="cx7ax6e" parent_id="t1_cx7agyk" type="reply">http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/seinfeld-well.gif</Comment><Comment author="dirtyfries" date="1448080806.0" date_utc="1448052006.0" id="cx7a9zm" parent_id="t1_cx79yk1" type="reply">too crazy; did not bother</Comment><Comment author="TheCheshireCody" date="1448082066.0" date_utc="1448053266.0" id="cx7b2zl" parent_id="t1_cx79tnz" type="reply">Nice [copypasta](http://www.anonymousconservative.com/).</Comment><Comment author="nein_danke" date="1448085386.0" date_utc="1448056586.0" id="cx7d4oe" parent_id="t1_cx79tnz" type="reply">Boring tbh.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="Gastrodemocracy" date="1448073598.0" date_utc="1448044798.0" id="3tliax" num_total_comments="0" num_true_comments="0" title="Former Rand Paul advisers re-indicted" type="post">Former Rand Paul advisers re-indicted : </Post><Post author="njmaverick" date="1448139150.0" date_utc="1448110350.0" id="3torsf" num_total_comments="23" num_true_comments="22" title="Will the GOP force us to remove &quot;the home of the brave&quot; from our national anthem?" type="post">Will the GOP force us to remove "the home of the brave" from our national anthem? : One of the interesting things about the current conservative movement is that it turns human values upside down.  Greed is good, intolerance is good and cowardice is good.    Cowardice has become such a powerful driver of Republican politics that the new elephant should be replaced by a chicken.  Consider:

With the latest Ebola outbreak the cowardly GOP wanted Africa quarantined (even though it would have needless killed Millions of Africans) because they were afraid.   They demanded people who in no way were infected with the disease here in the US be imprisoned not out of sound science but out of an irrational fear.

Now the GOP wants to turn away babies, orphans, women and senior citizens all because they are afraid.  

America was founded by brave men and women.  People who were willing to risk death and in many cases made the ultimate sacrifice.

Yet now we have become a nation where nearly half the voting population have become the most cowardly of people. <Comments><Comment author="Pi6" date="1448140030.0" date_utc="1448111230.0" id="cx7xes8" parent_id="t3_3torsf" type="comment">But 'And the home of the pussies' has such a good ring to it. </Comment><Comment author="RealRepub" date="1448150156.0" date_utc="1448121356.0" id="cx81aa2" parent_id="t1_cx7xes8" type="reply">Rename them RepublaPussies. </Comment><Comment author="bkrusch" date="1448140416.0" date_utc="1448111616.0" id="cx7xj2k" parent_id="t3_3torsf" type="comment">Well said.</Comment><Comment author="RxVote" date="1448139960.0" date_utc="1448111160.0" id="cx7xe2b" parent_id="t3_3torsf" type="comment">"Cowardly" is too mild a term to use to describe the harm they are doing to democracy and humanity.

These things are on a scale of preference. They may want sharia law but still prefer economic security and safety over that desire.

&gt;One thing is wanting to preserve their values another is saying that they want a religious government.

That depends on what those values are.

&gt;That sounds condescending. What we need is respect, we must not impose our values or way of thinking like we're on the right here.

Actually not all values are equal and there is nothing wrong with imposing values. That is one of the things laws do. They impose values on some who may disagree. e.g laws about killing are supposed to impose certain values on people or groups who may disagree. That is why killing someone for being homosexual or leaving the religion is not a justification while killing in self defense or defense of another is.</Comment><Comment author="AriD2385" date="1448117545.0" date_utc="1448088745.0" id="cx7s1pp" parent_id="t3_3tnuzm" type="comment">The question should not be whether the refugees pose a risk of terrorism, but rather whether they are interested in embracing Western democracy and culture.  I would sooner have them read the US Constitution and ask if they support that.  If yes, great.  If not, it's a no go.  A large portion of people in Muslim countries believe in and practice things that we would consider terrible and, as Maher said, contrary to our values.  "Jihadist" and "Nominal Muslim" are the endpoints of a spectrum, and you don't have to believe that all or even many Muslims are terrorists to know that many do, however, have a worldview distinct from that of the West in ways most Westerners would consider regressive. Maher is unique in that, unlike most on the left (see John Oliver) he does not assume that everyone in the world is enamoured with Western standards of behavior, thought, and politics and eager to become similar.  </Comment><Comment author="jrzalman" date="1448120846.0" date_utc="1448092046.0" id="cx7t02l" parent_id="t3_3tnuzm" type="comment">There is no 'Our Values'.

His rants again Islam are no better than those made by the Klukkers and white supremacists who show up in reddit to stereotype black people. I think having once been fired for "complimenting" radical Islamists has triggered a psychological disturbance in the guy. 

I understand where he's coming from when he says he's talking about things like spousal rape, honor killings, and eradication of gays being formal tenets of Islam, but he loses me when he translates that into, "therefore, all Muslims are bad".   How long did it take for the Western cultures to go away from their legally codified practices that openly and willfully subjugated women and minorities? One could argue that it's only within the last 50 -70 years that we in America have become so much better than the people Maher castigates. 

Most liberals choose not to have the First World myopia and tunnel vision Maher has about Muslims.

People have been burning mosques in western countries in response to this.  The idea of a database has entered the narrative in the media. Some people are talking about the refugees as if they contain significant numbers of ISIS fighters. People are acting based on statistically illogical threats and they are doing so in a way that feeds ISIS plans. 

We need to be proactive by reaching out to the Muslim groups in our areas and making sure that the young and impressionable people there don't feel isolated and hated. There needs to be pressure leaders towards cooperation, Russia, the US, the EU the AU,  Saudia Arabia and Iran. </Comment><Comment author="codyave" date="1448131173.0" date_utc="1448102373.0" id="cx7vdwr" parent_id="t1_cx7uzr1" type="reply">ISIS doesn't concern me. 

What *concerns me* is the research that shows a non-insignificant percentage of Muslims who see women, minorities and many other groups as second-class citizens, who support Sharia in western nations, who are okay with capital punishment for apostasy, and who don't mind limiting an individual's free speech when the Islamic religion or the Prophet Mohammed is criticized.

ISIS represents something far worse,  not to mention normalizing western culture with individual Muslims by interacting with them in a meaningful and cooperative way is likely to break down many barriers.

Trump has been outspoken on political issues for decades.  Just go look up interviews by Donald Trump from the 1980s and he's pretty much been saying the exact same thing he's saying now, oddly enough, about imbalanced and bad trade deals for the US with places like China.

Trump got famous for writing incredibly popular business books and being very rich in New York. He didn't get famous because of The Apprentice.

As for the "Trump would absolutely put Muslims in a database" articles
Unedited video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q4SDWMnjak

&gt;Reporter: Should there be a database system that tracks the Muslims here in this country?

&gt;Trump: There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. But right now, we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what&#8217;s happening to this country happen any longer.

&gt;Reporter: But that&#8217;s something your White House would like to implement?

&gt;Trump: Oh, I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.

&gt;Reporter: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work?

&gt;Trump: It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.

It's obvious he was talking about the wall when he said "absolutely"

**Strong encryption isn't helping terrorism, but it is helping consumer innovation.** New, cutting edge encryption technologies with applications in finance, data storage, and logistics engineering are emerging today and weak encryption would render these technologies useless. Meanwhile, terrorists are using *unencrypted SMS* and *plain print magazines* to recruit and communicate with each other.

Encryption is vital in the digital age to protect our rights to privacy and freedom of speech. Encryption ensures that we are able to exercise our freedom of speech without interference from malicious parties. Encryption ensures that we are able to exercise our right to privacy within our personal digital effects. Encryption ensures that companies that innovate are able to protect their property and that companies that handle large amounts of consumer data are able to protect it from malicious parties. In an age fraught with identity theft and phishing attacks, **strong encryption is a vital tool for the everyday American consumer**.

There is no sense in this idea at all. In a world where encryption is weakened for the sake of security, there *is no security*. We stand on the verge of a new movement in information systems technology that is dependent on strong encryption. Remove access to this vital tool, and you rob the American people of their protections under the 1st and 4th Amendments while destroying the future of American innovation and placing their personal information at risk of theft or worse.</Comment><Comment author="greenascanbe" date="1448144702.0" date_utc="1448115902.0" id="cx7yydj" parent_id="t3_3tox0j" type="comment">and yet we have this [After Endless Demonization Of Encryption, Police Find Paris Attackers Coordinated Via Unencrypted SMS](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151118/08474732854/after-endless-demonization-encryption-police-find-paris-attackers-coordinated-via-unencrypted-sms.shtml) and [Restricting Encryption Would Not Have Prevented the Paris Attacks](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/the-paris-attacks-are-no-reason-to-restrict-encryption/416391/)

Seriously gun control zealots - **We get it**.

You don't mind going against due process because you hate guns *that much*.  

It doesn't matter that [nearly a third](http://c6.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/1nVfmxG.jpg) of the terrorist watch list names have no known connection to terrorism.  

It doesn't matter that [only 25,000 names on the list](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/terror-watch-list_n_5651757.html?1407262653) are US citizens or permanent residents (in most cases, really the only ones who can legally buy guns in the US).

These are inconvenient truths that stand in the way of any way you can restrict gun rights in the false name of safety.

Correct it doesn't matter.  I'm glad we agree that both of those issues are in relation to existing standards for watch lists.

Most of those heightened security lists need revision / public information / procedure clarified, and have since inception.</Comment><Comment author="losthalo7" date="1448143804.0" date_utc="1448115004.0" id="cx7ymns" parent_id="t3_3toscx" type="comment">Did we ever get any more information on how you get on the 'terror watch lists', how to get taken off if you're on there by mistake, etc?

Actually we do, being my point.  If they were convicted of a crime, it has little to do with their current status.

We can deny the ownership of firearms to anyone.

["Due process is the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process) The right to own a firearm as a civilian on its face is an innate right that isn't subject to an approval process.

It's a serious question and one that deserves real thought... prior to his campaign, did anyone under the age of 50 even know who Sanders was? I'd argue more than 90% of his supporters didn't even know his name until 3 or 4 months ago. Now they claim he's the second coming.

A christian might say what Westmoreland does is not consistent with The New Testament  and the teachings of Jesus. That Statement is essentially true. 

I am no expert on How a member of the Westmoreland church would classify themselves. I would guess they would say fundamentalist Christianity.  

i would also guess that many Americans would describe Westmoreland as practicing fundamentalist Christianity.  

There is no basis that I can see, however, of identifying them as fundamental Christians. Their behavior is mostly inconsistent with The message attributed to Jesus Christ.
 
Still they are classified my most of us as a kind of Christian church.

I can see the fear that Muslims who do not support or condone  ISIS behavior have, that all Muslims will be put into the "same bag".  And so it is understandable a muslim might say those psychopaths are not Practicing islam. That same Muslim may or may not read the qu ran literally. They may pick and choose which of Muhammad's teachings  they follow.

They do not agree that ISIS practices Islam as fundamentalists. Yet that seems to to be the sad reality.  Ex-muslim's especially Atheists seem to me, for the most part, accept that Islam is not a religion of peace.

Politicians who deny that ISIS has anything to do with Islam recognize that most Muslims who live peacefully are deeply offended and afraid of they term. Diplomatically it using it would likely hurt Western society, more than help us.

Even if it is true, as i believe it is , that ISIS are Muslims, calling them that on the international is a really bad idea.

I wish i was better at being more concise when i wish to comment. Thank you to whomever takes the time to read what i wrote.

But to date, Bernie Sanders hasn't indicated this would be the case. He has stated numerous times that the funds for the new/improved social(ist) programs he is proposing would come from securities transactions, large corporations, and super-wealthy individuals. 

Not disagreeing that your definition of socialism is a bad thing, but I think Bernie Sanders has been pretty clear that that is not he's trying to do.

Loss of wealth to the rich doesn't hurt then the same as say loss if wealth to the poor, but the human element still will be hurt by it, and look for ways to "fix" it, which for them is as I said, raise prices on products. Which in turns means the lower classes are actually hurt more by tax increases than the rich are. So effectively it becomes a tax on the middle and lower classes over the long run, which in turn leads to people again saying lets raise taxes on the rich, and the cycle repeats. And it will work for a while as the U.S. Has one if lowest tax burdens and so the rich will continue just raising priced rather than looking for somewhere else to move. But once the tax burden catches up to other nations, then they will start to move to those nations and leave the U.S. And then the money starts to dry up leaving millions who have become dependent on the social programs suddenly without them. And we have a very large problem. It will take time to get there, probably wouldn't even happen in our generation, but long term effects of such a program are horrible, reform needs to happen in current system, but bernies plan, although great sounding and at least better than calls to switch to pure socialism outtight is not the way.</Comment><Comment author="r0ninj3di" date="1448067133.0" date_utc="1448038333.0" id="cx719w2" parent_id="t1_cx70pn6" type="reply">Are there any real-world examples of this happening?

To say he's half true really doesn't help someone truly understand what he said and what they found. He basically said two things. 1)The program spied on mosques and was shut down. 2) the mayor was the one who stopped it. Part 1 is correct. The demographics unit stopped. Edit: he said the nypd stopped spying on mosques and politifact takes issue because we don't know what they're doing now. That's kinda splitting hairs, but I guess he did say the nypd and not the program. Part 2 is a little hazier, but trump is pretty close to the mark. 

Now excuse me while I go wash my mouth out for having defending trump as being correct.</Comment><Comment author="philnotfil" date="1448081367.0" date_utc="1448052567.0" id="cx7amzb" parent_id="t3_3tlvwd" type="comment">Only half true because it was the mayor's appointee, not the mayor, who shut down the spying on mosques?</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="Jonahrod20" date="1448076190.0" date_utc="1448047390.0" id="3tlopy" num_total_comments="11" num_true_comments="11" title="Trump: 'I&#8217;m the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters'" type="post">Trump: 'I&#8217;m the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters' : <Comments><Comment author="dirtyfries" date="1448076831.0" date_utc="1448048031.0" id="cx77ork" parent_id="t3_3tlopy" type="comment">drunk and suicidal?</Comment><Comment author="rapaza" date="1448079129.0" date_utc="1448050329.0" id="cx796ul" parent_id="t3_3tlopy" type="comment">&#8220;[I was taught] to distrust adjectives as I would later learn to distrust certain people in certain situations.&#8221;

Softball questions and the candidates substituting generalities from their stump speeches for answers. Little to no followup on statements that were false or misleading.

Please come down from your high horse oh mighty one.  Alot of projecting there, eh?  A main part of Operation Iraqi Freedom was humanitarian to overthrow a brutal dictator and the left couldn't run into the streets fast enough with their premade "no war for oil" &amp; "no blood for oil" signs.

What's a damn shame is all the Syrian and Iraqi males of fighting age fleeing their country instead of fighting for it.  They're pussies but you take the easy progressive route and blame America. Have an upvote big guy.

&gt;Questioner: But the fact is, isn't it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps?

&gt;Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger." By 1968 you can't say "nigger" &#8212; that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me &#8212; because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."</Comment><Comment author="wiking85" date="1448146750.0" date_utc="1448117950.0" id="cx7zr83" parent_id="t3_3tp3jg" type="comment">And give up the political bonus of appearing pro-Vet without having to lift a finger for them?

Seriously gun control zealots - **We get it**.

You don't mind going against due process because you hate guns *that much*.  

It doesn't matter that [nearly a third](http://c6.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/1nVfmxG.jpg) of the terrorist watch list names have no known connection to terrorism.  

It doesn't matter that [only 25,000 names on the list](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/terror-watch-list_n_5651757.html?1407262653) are US citizens or permanent residents (in most cases, really the only ones who can legally buy guns in the US).

These are inconvenient truths that stand in the way of any way you can restrict gun rights in the false name of safety.  

We get it, but we're so glad that **people just don't want to listen to you**. </Comment><Comment author="bat_gold" date="1448152625.0" date_utc="1448123825.0" id="cx82iv3" parent_id="t3_3tp1sj" type="comment">Wouldn't that tip them off to being a suspect and possibly harm the investigation?</Comment><Comment author="mafco" date="1448148040.0" date_utc="1448119240.0" id="cx80b19" parent_id="t3_3tp1sj" type="comment">It's ironic that even though people in the US are far more likely to be killed by a home-grown mass shooter than a foreign born Islamic terrorist we have an 18-24 month vetting process for Syrian refugees yet can't even consider a five minute universal background check or denying weapons sales to even suspected terrorists here at home.</Comment><Comment author="demagogue451" date="1448149550.0" date_utc="1448120750.0" id="cx80zpf" parent_id="t1_cx80b19" type="reply">The GOP proposed an instant national mandated universal background check, sadly Harry Reid refused to bring it up for a vote even though he promised.

The Manchin Toomey bill that failed in the senate was a terrible implementation that the public doesn't want.  It failed because people like me contacted their senators.

Lets give the coburn proposal another try.  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/27/do-it-yourself-background-checks/2088479/

But denying constitutionally protected rights to *suspects* where there is no transparency for *why* these people are even on the list is unacceptable.  Due process is needed to deny rights, take them to court and remove their rights if you want, but we can't deny rights based on this secret watch list.</Comment><Comment author="britepeanutsgh" date="1448145616.0" date_utc="1448116816.0" id="cx7zawd" parent_id="t3_3tp1sj" type="comment">"It is appalling that ~~anti-gun~~ politicians are exploiting the Paris terrorist attacks to push their *insert issue here* agenda and distract from President Obama's failed foreign policy," Baker said."

Right now, just about everyone is using the terrorist attacks - using our culture of fear - to push their agenda. 

And that's where we get into trouble and where we get idiotic laws like the PATRIOT Act that allowed for NSA spying - and collecting the names of gun owners.

It's all knee-jerk politics. 

But what can be said. People are panicking. They're scared.

If the people on the list are really dangerous, charge them with a crime and put them in prison.  Otherwise, they are still a threat whether they can buy a gun from a gun store or not.

Incidentally, the terrorists in paris didn't stroll into a gun store and buy those fully automatic AK47s, they got them illegally, and the gun laws there didn't stop them.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="Sybles" date="1448142162.0" date_utc="1448113362.0" id="3towfu" num_total_comments="6" num_true_comments="6" title="Sarah Palin Says Legal Pot Is 'Absolutely No Big Deal'" type="post">Sarah Palin Says Legal Pot Is 'Absolutely No Big Deal' : <Comments><Comment author="theLusitanian" date="1448142906.0" date_utc="1448114106.0" id="cx7ybma" parent_id="t3_3towfu" type="comment">..two reasonable sounding statements in as many weeks..

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/02/europes-current-anti-migrant-rhetoric-carries-echoes-of-1930s-anti-semitism/

&gt;Consider this 1938 article in the Daily Mail, a British tabloid still known for its bouts of right-wing populism. Its headline warned of "German Jews Pouring Into This Country." And it began as follows:

&gt;"The way stateless Jews and Germans are pouring in from every port of this country is becoming an outrage. I intend to enforce the law to the fullest."

&gt;In these words, Mr Herbert Metcalde, the Old Street Magistrate yesterday referred to the number of aliens entering this country through the 'back door' -- a problem to which The Daily Mail has repeatedly pointed.

&gt;The number of aliens entering this country can be seen by the number of prosecutions in recent months. It is very difficult for the alien to escape the increasing vigilance of the police and port authorities.

&gt;Even if aliens manage to break through the defences, it is not long before they are caught and deported.



RE: Economic concerns in Europe and its perceived inability to resettle immigrants:

&gt; In France alone, there were a million people unemployed. Resentment against French and foreign Jews (large numbers from Germany and Romania had arrived by the early 1930s) led to "a new wave of antisemitism," detailed by a report put out by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

&gt;The Chamber of Commerce of the city of Metz, for example, grumbled in 1933 that "highly undesirable" Jews "have become a veritable plague for honest French merchants."</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="Daniels001" date="1448067246.0" date_utc="1448038446.0" id="3tl2om" num_total_comments="0" num_true_comments="0" title="Liberal 'dark money' group rails against 'dark money'" type="post">Liberal 'dark money' group rails against 'dark money' : </Post><Post author="sonnyclips" date="1448064546.0" date_utc="1448035746.0" id="3tkw6v" num_total_comments="0" num_true_comments="0" title="The Page Who Took Down the GOP: Why I leaked the scandalous Mark Foley messages&#8212;and what I regret about it." type="post">The Page Who Took Down the GOP: Why I leaked the scandalous Mark Foley messages&#8212;and what I regret about it. : </Post><Post author="shaolung" date="1448129086.0" date_utc="1448100286.0" id="3toff0" num_total_comments="3" num_true_comments="3" title="Musicians at Latin Grammys tell viewers: &#8216;Don&#8217;t vote for racists'" type="post">Musicians at Latin Grammys tell viewers: &#8216;Don&#8217;t vote for racists' : <Comments><Comment author="codyave" date="1448131732.0" date_utc="1448102932.0" id="cx7vi2y" parent_id="t3_3toff0" type="comment">This racist schtick is *almost* getting old. </Comment><Comment author="chickpeakiller" date="1448143724.0" date_utc="1448114924.0" id="cx7ylmi" parent_id="t1_cx7vi2y" type="reply">Or, you know the Republican politicians are just kind of racist...</Comment><Comment author="filthymacgyver21" date="1448141770.0" date_utc="1448112970.0" id="cx7xya3" parent_id="t1_cx7vi2y" type="reply">Very</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="BenRayfield" date="1448117507.0" date_utc="1448088707.0" id="3to10r" num_total_comments="10" num_true_comments="10" title="There is nobody and nowhere outside the reach of many kinds of WMDs - If you have not seen it yet, take it in, Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is mostly what protects us, not some delusion that WMDs cant reach you" type="post">There is nobody and nowhere outside the reach of many kinds of WMDs - If you have not seen it yet, take it in, Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is mostly what protects us, not some delusion that WMDs cant reach you : <Comments><Comment author="SenorTylerDurden" date="1448121710.0" date_utc="1448092910.0" id="cx7t88h" parent_id="t3_3to10r" type="comment">Fear monger a bit more.

* If it becomes too easy to create WMDs, then many individuals wont be able to balance power between eachother as easily as fewer more powerful groups.

* If some groups value conflict over their own survival, and if they can either get WMDs or provoke a conflict between others who have them, then there is no peaceful solution.

We should always use the least force needed, but its an open question if using less force now leads to having to use more force later, or in which combinations there is less force averaged over time.

Is Hillary proposing single payer? I'm pretty sure she isn't. O'Malley certainly isn't. I think Bernie is the only one proposing single payer. My point was that $250K is generally considered the upper limit of the upper middle class.  

&gt;This is not raising the taxes for raising the taxes, it is to pay for a programme that everybody will get to use and that will save money for most people.

The problem is that if you want to lower taxes to 95% of people without cutting expenses you can't afford to cut that much.

Robert Reich videos made me a "true believer" in Medicare for all, so I really think the tax increase is worth it.

That would be ridiculous.  No, no.  He wants a watchlist.  You know, just a list of all the American Muslims.  They would have to sign up to be on it, of course, but they could do it at any number of places.  It would be super convenient.  But that way we would know who the Muslims are, so we can keep an eye on them, you know?  For safety.  Nothing at all like a database.

&gt;The American system of public schooling is unusual for a modern state, as most nations rely upon education systems operated by the national government. The education system in the United States is actually a set of state-based systems. There is, however, a federal government role in education, and national education organizations and activities exist. **But the ultimate authority&#8211;what is called plenary authority&#8211;for schooling in the United States resides with the individual states.**

http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html

&gt;Education is primarily a State and local responsibility in the United States. It is States and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds, that establish schools and colleges, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation. The structure of education finance in America reflects this predominant State and local role. Of an estimated $1.15 trillion being spent nationwide on education at all levels for school year 2011-2012, a substantial majority will come from State, local, and private sources. This is especially true at the elementary and secondary level, where about 87.7 percent of the funds will come from non-Federal sources. 

If anything, the federal government needs to step farther in. Make it so Alabama and the like can't teach creationism in science class.</Comment><Comment author="Themostunderdisturb" date="1448073412.0" date_utc="1448044612.0" id="cx75fy2" parent_id="t1_cx7569x" type="reply">And how does that help the people of Chicago with their 50% literacy rate?

No, but they are being taught in schools that are more segregated now than they were before Brown v. Board of Education.

The whole point of student-run, student-supported media is that it could serve to express views and thoughts that would otherwise be unable to be heard in the din of commercial media, which must always cater to the least common denominator/median consumer.

The issues these students raise are real; they're the ones paying the bills and campuses are *supposed* to be a microcosm for developing the skills to effect useful change-- both social and academic.  

BUT.  The differences between what is being protested now (good manners VS military draft, hurt feels VS your peers coming home in a box,) and the social realities ("systemic racism" in a society that literally forbids it VS systemic racism in a society that had codified it,) render the whole thing more pathetic than revolutionary.

Many young people today don't realize the profound effect the draft lottery had on us boomers. Before the lottery, the wealthier children could avoid the draft by going to college (although it was much cheaper then). When the lottery came in, high number kids could relax. It was a brilliant move, given the arbitrary nature of the draft boards before that.

It's refreshing to hear a truthful statement from a liberal.  This is why Democrats support illegal immigration.  It alters the demographics of the nation even if they don't vote initially.

Bush has a Mexican wife.  Having her out there may make him look soft in illegal immigration.

Trump has a European wife.  Trump doesn't have a soft message on illegal immigration.

The best argument for why it isn't this simple is that your explanation requires the idea that car dealers are willingly and intentionally earning less money on car loans to white people because they are white people.

&gt;This was apparently too much for banks and auto dealers to handle. They lobbied for a bill that would nullify the CFPB's regulatory move.

Damned right it was too much. The Ally Bank case was a settlement not a judicial decision. DoJ used the deceptive practice of 'disparate impact' (not disparate treatment) to harass Ally Bank into a settlement lest the DoJ call them 'racists.'

This case was holder acting just like jesse jackson. I encourage all to read-up on the case and the methodologies used to determine who is black and white and how they inferred those and how they never compared people by credit-worthiness and on and on - disgusting.

Banks know one color, green. If you can get them some green, they'll do what you want. I can only imagine the threats the banking lobby made to get these jackasses to back-off and bend over for this law. 

This is a case where the 'evil' banks used their power for good.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="Jane_Joyce" date="1448136548.0" date_utc="1448107748.0" id="3toodm" num_total_comments="0" num_true_comments="0" title="Andrew Neil's message to those who attacked Paris" type="post">Andrew Neil's message to those who attacked Paris : </Post><Post author="Park_Way" date="1448114241.0" date_utc="1448085441.0" id="3tnw0h" num_total_comments="33" num_true_comments="33" title="Make it simple guys.

At least get your facts right.

Taliban offered to hand Osama over to GW Bush if he could provide any evidence **at all*** that Bin Laden was involved in 9/11 in any way. Bush refused and started bombing.

&gt; the Taliban wasn't our target at first.

Correct, Iraq was always the target, Afghanistan was only the stepping stone and the 'justification" for getting troops into the area. Which is why they had to fabricate all of the evidence required to make the leap from Afghanistan into Iraq.</Comment><Comment author="MyniggaTim" date="1448082936.0" date_utc="1448054136.0" id="cx7bmf5" parent_id="t1_cx7b98r" type="reply">Keyword "former"</Comment><Comment author="JimmyNelson" date="1448082318.0" date_utc="1448053518.0" id="cx7b8n7" parent_id="t3_3tm3ob" type="comment">That adviser must be racist.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="JackassWhisperer" date="1448080610.0" date_utc="1448051810.0" id="3tlzql" num_total_comments="11" num_true_comments="11" title="Hillary Clinton calls for cooperation on encryption" type="post">Hillary Clinton calls for cooperation on encryption : <Comments><Comment author="BernieBro" date="1448081646.0" date_utc="1448052846.0" id="cx7atcs" parent_id="t3_3tlzql" type="comment">[Uhm, that's a big fat nope.](http://youtu.be/mJXYMDu6dpY)</Comment><Comment author="dirtyfries" date="1448080991.0" date_utc="1448052191.0" id="cx7aebu" parent_id="t3_3tlzql" type="comment">Encryption is the bogeyman here so they can get into everything.</Comment><Comment author="netizen539" date="1448083599.0" date_utc="1448054799.0" id="cx7c1er" parent_id="t3_3tlzql" type="comment">"Co-operation" on encryption cannot exist if that encryption is going to actually work.

Everything about Hillary is fake. Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie, a deception, a false apology. No ideology, no morals. She only switched her view on gay marriage to full support in 2013, and then claimed that she supported it all along.

Read up on Super PAC laws. THERE ARE NO LAWS STATING THEY CANNOT RECEIVE UNLIMITED FUNDING FROM ANY SOURCE.

Where people get this idea that a Super PAC started by a nursing union means they can only receive funding from nurses is beyond me.

&gt;At that point you may as well consider "Americans" a special interest group.

How is a union **not** a special interest group? No seriously, I would love to hear your thoughts on how that is different from a group that you do consider a special interest group.</Comment><Comment author="Reaper7707" date="1448075172.0" date_utc="1448046372.0" id="cx76lth" parent_id="t1_cx75wue" type="reply">Except this particular PAC discloses its donor amounts, and follows finance law, unlike a real super PAC. They were founded before SuperPACs existed and are following the same rules as then. Also, $500,000 total money used supporting Sanders is a far cry from what the actual Super PACs are out there doing. 

As for the special interest part, the difference lies in how many people are represented by that interest. For example, the gun lobby represents what... gun manufacturers? (they will claim to care about gun owners but we both know they just mean gun owners' wallets). Big Oil? Big Pharma? They represent a specific interest of a relative few. Unions tend to represent the betterment of working class people. What's good for one group of workers is often good for all workers, and they don't typically have to go to battle AGAINST the interests of another large-scale group of people to get what they want. And I would say any group who, intentionally or not, promotes "the general welfare" like our founding fathers used to talk about is not a special interest. 

Let me do this though - here's Sanders himself, this is a quote from his book Outsider in the House, from 1997 (before Super PACs even). (It has also been republished for his white House run).
&gt;"While I will not accept PAC money from corporate America, I gladly accept PAC contributions from organizations fighting to improve life for ordinary people. Over the years, my campaigns have received strong financial support from PACs associated with organized labor, the environment, women, senior citizens, human rights, and the needs of children. That is continuing in this campaign.

&gt;The general ignorance surrounding the issue of campaign financing is frustrating. My opponents call me a "hypocrite" for accepting PAC money. How can I accept PAC money, they say, and then claim that I am fighting against "special interests"? Isn't a PAC, by definition, a "special interest"? Aren't all PAC contributions the same? Does it make any difference who the PAC represents?

&gt;Such questions, which are repeated ad nauseam in the media, reflect a lack of understanding of the role of money in politics. So, let me be very clear about this. I do not believe that working people are a special interest. I do not believe that hungry kids are a special interest. I do not believe that fighting for the right of women to control their own bodies is a special interest. I do not believe that protecting the environment is a special interest."

Given the past actions of Hamas you can definitely argue they have used terror. I don't think Israel has been clean though. Every time Hamas launches rockets into Israel and kills two Israelis it seems like Israel then kills 40 Palestinians and claims it was all military targets, which doesn't seem to be true. It is really a two sided war of terror in my opinion. Neither side is without guilt.

The line people keep using, "Israel uses missiles to protect people (Iron Dome) and Hamas uses people to protect missiles (human shields)."

Israel is a liberal democracy which has consistently wanted peace with their neighbors.  Hamas's own charter is based in radical Islamism (no human rights, no democracy), is extremely anti-Semitic and states that their goal is to wipe out Israel completely.

You can't make any comparison between Hamas and Israel.  Israel is fundamentally just defending their country the way any sane person would.  You act like Israel should allow Hamas to kill people because "the rockets only kill like 2 people, geez, get over it dudes."  Is there any country on earth that would let terrorists fire rockets at them with no response?  No country that would exist very long, because that's basically committing suicide as a nation.  Israel isn't perfect obviously, they make mistakes and they have some fundamentalists who make the situation untenable.

The Arab people in the West Bank and Gaza mostly don't want to be Israeli citizens.  They don't want to vote in Israeli elections or be a part of a Jewish state.  Is that Israel's fault?  And, Israel offered the Palestinian leadership their own state and they said no.

Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to **Iran** for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS.

Worker 2: &#8220;I fix their jets and limousines!&#8221;

Worker 3: &#8220;I build their mansions!&#8221;

Workers 1-3 Together: &#8220;And we are middle class Republicans! Some jealous people call us &#8220;crazy&#8221;, &#8220;suckers&#8221;, &#8220;authoritarians.&#8221; But we willingly surrender pay, benefits and our very lives to make our wealthy employers more profit and comfort for a spectacularly luxurious lifestyle that we&#8217;ll never experience.&#8221;

&#8220;Some Dimorats say, &#8220;Join a Labor Union to level the bargaining field with your Boss.&#8221; We say, &#8220;NO WAY, Comrade!&#8221; Labor Unions are Cartels and if we don&#8217;t like our jobs, we can just find new ones. That&#8217;s how the free market works! Dumbocrats.&#8221;

Worker 3: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I was giving up enough pay and benefits so I volunteered my son and daughter for military service in the latest unlawful invasion of some dirt-poor third world country. My kids are heroes. And they would tell you that themselves if they were still alive. But my bosses at KBR made a killing on governmental contracts. We are all heroes now and we know it.&#8221;

Worker 2: &#8220;It is not fair to burden the wealthy job creators with taxes, environmental regulations, or fair pay and labor laws. They earned that wealth all by themselves and no liberal democrat will take it away to give to terrorists and minorities.&#8221;

Worker 1: &#8220;Someday, I too will be a rich boss even though I stand a better chance of hitting the Lotto ten times in a row. Math and statistics were removed from the public schools in favor of Bible studies so I can&#8217;t give you the precise odds of my future success. But I have faith that I&#8217;ll be rich and I don&#8217;t want any jealous leftists or statists confiscating my hard earned wealth.&#8221;

All 3 Together: &#8220;We did our part for them, now you can too. Vote REPUBLICAN and give until it hurts&#8230;.you, not them.&#8221;

So when it comes to foreign policy, I'll stick with the party that isn't afraid of it's own shadow and that is already pushing for more large wars and invasions. 

And notice how they were pushing the 'bush era doctrine' on that program. Right. Sounds like they probably talked to people at oral robert's university or something as prep.

Because, one, America has always been a haven for immigrants and people seeking new lives, two, we do have an interest in international stability, three, just taking in the refugees is orders of magnitude cheaper than a military solution to Syria, and four, it's the right thing to do. That is, it's the right thing to take in people fleeing war and persecution.</Comment><Comment author="bam2_89" date="1448100618.0" date_utc="1448071818.0" id="cx7l2qb" parent_id="t1_cx74ih8" type="reply">Accepting their draft dodgers won't exactly contribute to the defeat of ISIS.</Comment><Comment author="Themostunderdisturb" date="1448072547.0" date_utc="1448043747.0" id="cx74utl" parent_id="t1_cx74ih8" type="reply">The right thing to do would have been not to foster and support a revolution in Syria to begin with.</Comment><Comment author="UrukHaiGuyz" date="1448072622.0" date_utc="1448043822.0" id="cx74wmv" parent_id="t1_cx74utl" type="reply">Now that we've contributed to the destabilization of the region, it's our moral obligation to support the refugees generated by that conflict. </Comment><Comment author="Themostunderdisturb" date="1448072895.0" date_utc="1448044095.0" id="cx753cr" parent_id="t1_cx74wmv" type="reply">The Syrian civil war was more the result of the world economic collapse.

More than 4 million Syrian refugees have been registered in neighboring countries. There are more who are undocumented. Lebanon's population is now 20%-25% Syrian refugees, and that's on top of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees that they already had. 

[2.2 million have been registered in Turkey](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224)

Yes, Saudi Arabia deserves criticism for not doing more. Still, ["There are 500,000 Syrians in Saudi Arabia, according to Nabil Othman, acting regional representative to the Gulf region at the UNHCR. In official documentation they are referred to as &#8220;Arab brothers and sisters in distress,&#8221; he said."](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/syria-s-refugees-feel-more-welcome-in-europe-than-in-the-gulf) I don't know how credible that is. I'm also not sure whether the Syrians in KSA are all people who were allowed to overstay their visas because it isn't safe for them to return to Syria, or if the Saudis took some additional Syrians on top of the ones who were already visiting or working there.

That is continuing in this campaign.
The general ignorance surrounding the issue of campaign financing is frustrating. My opponents call me a "hypocrite" for accepting PAC money. How can I accept PAC money, they say, and then claim that I am fighting against "special interests"? Isn't a PAC, by definition, a "special interest"? Aren't all PAC contributions the same? Does it make any difference who the PAC represents?
Such questions, which are repeated ad nauseam in the media, reflect a lack of understanding of the role of money in politics. So, let me be very clear about this. I do not believe that working people are a special interest. I do not believe that hungry kids are a special interest. I do not believe that fighting for the right of women to control their own bodies is a special interest. I do not believe that protecting the environment is a special interest."

&gt;National Nurses United super PAC is different than those supporting other candidates, like Priorities USA, a PAC backing Hillary Clinton, and Right to Rise, a group backing Jeb Bush.

The question leads down the rabbit hole of campaign finance law.

Here's what sets it apart from the presidential superPACs.

First, its donor list. The other superPACs are financed largely by millionaires. As for the NNU committee, "It's funded exclusively by our members," said Michael Lighty, the union's public policy director.

Technically, the PAC dates back to 2009, when independent expenditures were legal but the legal concept of superPACs did not yet exist. In the 2014 elections, Federal Election Commission records show, the nurses PAC spent $2.3 million, and was entirely funded by the union itself. There's only one disclosure report for this year, through June 30; the PAC reported getting no contributions at all.

Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in an email, "We are honored to have the support of National Nurses United."

Then he drew a line between the NNU PAC and the presidential superPACS. "We have not started a superPAC, are not coordinating with a superPAC, and we have not fundraised for a superPAC," he said. "We stand by our position that we do not want the help of a superPAC."

Ok call it whatever you want, but it's not a presidential superPAC that can take unlimited money from corporations and billionaires it's the nurses Union superPAC that only accepts donations from Nurses Union members. You know, real people who work for a living making small contributions to their Union.

There's nothing special about gun shows in federal law that allow private sellers to conduct sales there that they couldn't also conduct elsewhere.

Secondly, a loophole is "an ambiguity or inadequacy in a system, such as a law or security, which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the intent, implied or explicitly stated, of the system." [The law that excludes private sellers from the background check mandate applied to licensed dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968#Federal_Firearms_License_.28FFL.29_system) does so *specifically and intentionally*.

So, your "gun show loophole" is neither a loophole, nor does it have anything in particular to do with gun shows. QED

Hell, even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_show_loophole) acknowledges that this is a "political term" for the secondary market for firearms. "Closing the gun show loophole", therefore, is a coded phrase for "Banning the private, unmonitored transfer of firearms". 

&gt;Between 2004 and 2014, the FBI completed 2,233 background checks involving individuals on the watchlist. Only 190 individuals were declined, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

He's trying to fix whatever you want to call this ambiguity or inadequacy in the system that allows a 13 yr old, or anyone else to buy a gun without a background check, and without even having to present ID.

[Why the NRA fights background checks.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/10/opinion/donohue-background-checks/)

&gt;The direct loss of profit comes because closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system will shut off sales to criminals and the mentally ill who are effectively free to buy all the guns they want at gun shows and through private transactions.

&gt;But there is also an indirect loss of profit: Cutting off sales to the mentally ill and criminals will reduce crime and thereby reduce the public's demand for guns for self-protection.

&gt;The gun manufacturers saw gun sales plummet during the dark days of the Clinton administration when crime dropped sharply every year.

Absolutely cannot happen, unless someone **commits a federally illegal transfer**.

&gt;Yet the NRA does not support what the majority of its members want because the gun industry will lose profit.

Not true, the NRA is funded almost *entirely by members*, and really doesn't give a damn about gun rights beyond hunting and plinking.

All completely false. Gun ownership has continued to rise in the US year by year, while crime rates have dropped. This new trend of mass shootings has nothing to do with gun ownership, and **absolutely everything** to do with the media's glorification of these heinous crimes- giving lonely disinterested maniacs a spotlight (exactly what they desire in their seemingly insignificant lives) is the catalyst for these crimes. Criminal and psychological experts all agree.

It is my contention that is the purpose of this group that has no address or lists of officers or list of funding.  

It is meant to generate just exactly the response you are providing and since they have only attacked Democratic, obviously to separate African American voters from the Democratic party.  

I see them as just another dirty tricks operation, like when Nixon used "hired" violent anti-war protesters to appear at his campaign speeches.

Why does money dominate politics? It clearly cannot be so brazen as an outright bribe. However, a rose by any other name... is still a rose. Even if that other name is Super PAC, lobbying job, or what have you. Money to get the message out, to persuade us rubes to cast our lot which whomever has the biggest, flashiest message.

Like Native Americans should have been left to their own devices? Or no immigrants after the Revolution? Also, how does integrating immigrants into our culture not make us self-reliant? Those immigrants became Americans, and worked along side the Americans who were here before them, who were also most likely immigrants.

What sort of improvements could be made to our current fence to make it Trump's "great wall of America"? Many illegal immigrants are smuggled through tunnels, by sea, and border gates, how would trump's Great Wall prevent that? </Comment><Comment author="Prof_LauraSteiner" date="1448097437.0" date_utc="1448068637.0" id="cx7jk90" parent_id="t1_cx7jhss" type="reply">Trump will figure out a way to make it work.

Obviously you and are cut from pretty similar molds politically, so I'm preaching to the choir here. 

But, I really believe in Sanders ideal utopia, all money made goes to the government, and then all services are provided for free to the citizens... on top of that, a small monthly allowance is provided to give us some small amounts of very well regulated freedoms.

It's a serious conversation as to if that's a good vision or not, there are some significant perks to it... but it's not what America was built on. Nobody is guaranteed to ever make it, all America provides is a promise at having an equal shot to make it. You still might fail, but that's on you, win or lose, personal responsibility.

The Southern Thai Insurgency although it can be seen as a Nationalist movement it is also an Islamic insurgent movement.
The main leading Islamic insurgent groups are Salafi lead i.e inspired and perhaps funded (indirectly) by Whabbi Saudi Arabia - a client state of the US.
The adjacent Gulf of Thailand does have Oil and gas resources which may compete against US/Saudi interests.

Very tenuous but its a start, its a conflict I know almost zilch about.

&gt;Many experts rushed forward to immediately explain that states don&#8217;t have a right to simply ban huge swaths of legal immigrants from living in their state, but it&#8217;s doubtful that any of these governors actually intended to try. It&#8217;s all posturing for the cameras, showing the conservative base that you hate and fear Muslims just as much as they do.

&gt;Luckily for ISIS, the propaganda that works for the Christian right works just as perfectly for ISIS! The only people who want a &#8220;clash of civilizations&#8221; between Christianity and Islam more than conservative Christians is ISIS, which is, at its heart, an apocalyptic cult that wants to conquer the non-believers, both non-Muslims and Muslims who have a different take on Islam than ISIS fundamentalists do. So big ups from ISIS to every conservative who feeds the ISIS narrative with their hysterical anti-Muslim bleating.

He's not working for any real change, but a temporary relief for middle class people. He's pandering like the rest of them on that stage, but pandering to a wider audience than the 1%. He's gambling that this portion of society is going to trump the support someone like Hillary has, for example.

But, as the article says, real change comes with discussing the ownership and control within this system. We have veterans killing themselves because the government that sends us to die in the first place doesn't give a shit afterwards. We have employees getting shit on by the rest of society for wanting an actual living wage, even though the same people shitting on them are part of the same class struggling for the same thing.

Telling you folks, everyone reading this has the same interests and its high time we realize this and band together and recognize this. Bernie is a good start but he won't finish the fight for our welfare.

I feel like I agree with much of what Sunkara says. Disagree with some too, but he makes the point that "capitalists won't voluntarily give up their power".

Whose fault is it if you can't your bills? Always your own - so they should quit whining and get with the program. Work harder!

If you work 40 hours a week you are a slacker. Real men (cons) work 150 hours a week without a break and save every penny they have while sleeping in their car. They ain't living it up like someone on welfare who has a tv/fridge they got while working before and such.

So don't be a liberal and blame Obama for anything when it comes to money - it is always your own fault (unless you are Israel who gets handouts and corporations worth billions, etc - then handouts are 'earned').

It was not unusual for individual plans to have $10,000 deductibles. Now out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles, are capped at $6,850 for individual coverage and $13,700 for families. That's still a lot of money, obviously, but most plans have deductibles that are much lower. You may pay a higher monthly premium to get a lower deductible, but people should consider both when deciding on a plan. </Comment><Comment author="hastdubutthurt" date="1448082237.0" date_utc="1448053437.0" id="cx7b6tf" parent_id="t3_3tlr84" type="comment">This had been my question from the beginning.

&gt;"There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases," he said.

You're accusing the journalist of lying. Is that what you intended? 

I watched the video on CNN and it went like this:

I think a more important task is preparing refugees from villages in fundamentalist Muslim countries for American life.

Saudi Arabia is Wahaabist, which as Ben Swann notes is similar to Salafi, and according to the US, Saudi Arabia is an ally. So wishing a Salafist group to rise and counter Assad is not the same as wishing for the rise of an abhorrent terror movement. 

The US made a mistake in understating the threat such a Salafist group would be. The lesson to learn is that extremist Islamic groups should not be underestimated.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="GiveYourBestEffort" date="1448091341.0" date_utc="1448062541.0" id="3tmorw" num_total_comments="58" num_true_comments="68" title="Hillary Clinton: Gun Violence Is A National Emergency" type="post">Hillary Clinton: Gun Violence Is A National Emergency : <Comments><Comment author="brownribbon" date="1448091771.0" date_utc="1448062971.0" id="cx7gp3y" parent_id="t3_3tmorw" type="comment">It literally is not.</Comment><Comment author="VictoriousTrump" date="1448091481.0" date_utc="1448062681.0" id="cx7gjsb" parent_id="t3_3tmorw" type="comment">Even though its been going down for 20 years.</Comment><Comment author="ArjaaAine" date="1448093141.0" date_utc="1448064341.0" id="cx7hezb" parent_id="t3_3tmorw" type="comment">No, it is not.

I.E.  2nd amendment protections extend only to those weapons in common use for lawful purposes, a category which includes handguns and many other small arms. </Comment><Comment author="Killroyomega" date="1448102321.0" date_utc="1448073521.0" id="cx7lvcl" parent_id="t1_cx7l3iy" type="reply">There's a few problems with that.

The first is that "the militia" is a vague term. If we're talking about Revolutionary Army militia it'd be rifles and muskets. If we're talking about modern day militia, well that doesn't exist so it'd be basically anything.

The second problem is that the term "those in common use for lawful purposes" is even more vague. Is it common use for the time when the statement was made, or common use when interpreted?  Also what is "lawful purpose?" If a law is introduced that changes what is considered "lawful purpose" does this precedent supersede it or does the language suggest that a new precedent is created?

Regardless of any of that, [legal and constitutional restrictions have and continue to be placed on the sale and manufacturing of guns and weapons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Legal_challenges)</Comment><Comment author="BeartrapSandwich" date="1448103807.0" date_utc="1448075007.0" id="cx7mk82" parent_id="t1_cx7lvcl" type="reply">&gt;The first is that "the militia" is a vague term.

"The Militia" [is defined by the US federal code as all able-bodied male citizens between the ages of 17 and 45, plus all the women in the national guard.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/311) This term is not vague, especially when one considers the legal standpoint from which the Supreme Court argues. 

&gt;The second problem is that the term "those in common use for lawful purposes" is even more vague. 

I disagree.

&gt;Is it common use for the time when the statement was made, or common use when interpreted? 

When interpreted.

&gt;Also what is "lawful purpose?" 

Anything that is not against the law. 

&gt;If a law is introduced that changes what is considered "lawful purpose" does this precedent supersede it or does the language suggest that a new precedent is created?

This question doesn't make any sense. The ruling holds that the 2nd amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear those arms in common use for lawful purposes. If a new law was passed that changed what one could lawfully do with a firearm, nothing would change with regards to *which guns* can be owned under the 2nd amendment.  

If, however, a new kind of gun was invented that was overwhelmingly used for unlawful purposes (for example, a gun that can only kill cops), the 2nd amendment could not be used to defend one's right to keep and bear that firearm. 

&gt;Regardless of any of that, legal and constitutional restrictions have and continue to be placed on the sale and manufacturing of guns and weapons.

I don't dispute that in the slightest. Such reasonable regulations are necessary and, in my opinion, good for the country. I'm a leftist gun nut, not a gun rights maximalist. </Comment><Comment author="seltaeb4" date="1448103641.0" date_utc="1448074841.0" id="cx7mhhe" parent_id="t1_cx7l3iy" type="reply">Why doesn't the NRA file a lawsuit to bring back full-auto machine guns?

Because there's not much call for it, really. Full-auto isn't really practical from a self-defense standpoint and anyone that wants to spend some money making noise can rent one at the gun range for a little while, buy one if they want to overpay for an antique by a factor of 10 and sit through months of paperwork, or else become a gun dealer/range and get licensed to traffic in modern automatics.

Absolutely, but I'd prefer it in semi-auto. 700RPM burns through ammunition too quickly.</Comment><Comment author="ticsuap" date="1448108262.0" date_utc="1448079462.0" id="cx7oj9s" parent_id="t1_cx7gppg" type="reply">Hi `RSPotted`.

I'm religious and have no beef with Atheists. I suggest you learn to do the same and stop this cycle of hatred.    if someone says something polarizing ignore them.

When people do grandstanding like that I am reminded of this bible verse

"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. - [Matthew 6:5](http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm)

&gt;WHAT'S TRUE: Donald Trump was asked in an interview about whether Muslims should be subject to special scrutiny, a question he answered ambiguously. **He then later affirmed that Muslims should be required to register in a database.**</Comment><Comment author="dubrockets" date="1448069755.0" date_utc="1448040955.0" id="cx730b4" parent_id="t1_cx72ndh" type="reply">No he didn't. This is the ACTUAL part from that interview:

*****

NBC: Should there be a database system that tracks Muslims of this country?

TRUMP: There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today, you can do it. But right now we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall and we cannot let what&#8217;s happening to this country happening &#8211;

NBC: Is that something your White House would like to do?

TRUMP: I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.

*****

His answer to the "Is that something your White House would like to do" question was referencing his "we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall" statement right before that.

The contortions you are going through to make the situation slightly less appalling, wow.

Trump must not have a very good grasp of how to construct sentences properly, because he at the very least could've said "yes, we're going to secure the border, but, I'm not a fan of forced registration of Muslims at this point".

You're right, Trump ignoring the stupid questions clearly implies that Muslim citizens should fear for their lives if he gets elected.

That is one theory. However I wonder if perhaps Democrats' shift to the left and their rhetoric about Republicans in fact pushed people more right, not just Republicans but across the whole political spectrum.

Democrats for years now have been calling Republicans racists and sexists and xenophobic when a lot of the time they are merely stating their opinion. Or for just, heaven forbid, simply disagreeing with Obama.

Take the Syrian refugee situation as an example. Did the bill introduced in the House demand that refugees be turned away, especially children and women like those on the left insisted is what Republicans wanted? No. In fact the bill didn't even call for a slowdown in refugees, rather it just called for extra security after the terrorist attack in France.

Normally one would consider extra security a good thing, something that both sides should be able to agree on. Instead those on the left are still label not just Republicans, but also members of their own party as being xenophobic if they support extra security.

To me it seems the left is responsible for the rise of "super stars" such as Donald Trump. It would also explain why Hillary is more popular than Sanders, Hillary practically is a Republican.<Comments><Comment author="darkflame96" date="1448114695.0" date_utc="1448085895.0" id="cx7r3dt" parent_id="t3_3tnt33" type="comment">Republicans.

That means that by the time Obama took office a large portion of the American public had been listening exclusively to right-wing news for over a decade, and some for over 20.

Rush Limbaugh has done more to shift this country to the right than any single politician ever.

I can't put my finger on what the dynamics were at the time, but I remember very clearly how much impact he had in the early '90s.  Suddenly there was a divisiveness that hadn't existed before.  It had a voice.  Short, effective soundbites that seemed to encapsulate all the "problems" with the nation.

I should know.  I will admit I was guilty of being caught up in it.  Every day, there was 3 full hours of what I thought at the time was in-depth analysis of the ills facing this great country of ours.  It was so easy to see how so many things were wrong and how these things could be laid at the feet of "liberals".

I'm ashamed to admit that it took a few years for me to realize that the "problems" being addressed were never the real problems, and that the solutions being sold were the true problems.  The whole thing was a 3 hour "reality" show produced to sell advertising, and the companies buying those ads were trying to fuck me and everyone else who tuned in.

Every once in a while I turn the radio to Rush just to try and get a laugh.  Nothing has changed with the show, but now I chuckle a few times before getting so disgusted I simply can't take it anymore.</Comment><Comment author="senorStroganoff" date="1448114962.0" date_utc="1448086162.0" id="cx7r6s4" parent_id="t3_3tnt33" type="comment">&gt; demand that refugees be turned away, especially children and women like those on the left insisted is what Republicans wanted?

This was the rise of the Glenn Beck Libertarians. These are the people who were calling Obama illegitimate by saying he was a secret Muslim born in Kenya that palled around with terrorists, and had a crazy preacher (Reverend Wright). This was the crazy and hysterical shit that really made Republicans move farther to the Right. 

With people like Palin, Bachmann and Beck finally having a pedestal to proclaim that ignorance and education was elitist, it paved the way for the rest of the far-right religious faction of the GOP. Palin made *speaking like a simpleton* look like the norm. The Bachmann and Beck types riled up the fears and conspiracy theories of the far-right. 

It's been a downward spiral for the Tea Party types, and they paved the way for more like-minded legitimately crazy factions of the GOP. I'm talking about those who have held political office since Obama became President, and not just random bloggers and websites.

In Asian countries they have seen it all for thousands of years. China has a history that goes back to probably over 10 thousands of years and for a lot of that as a noteworthy civilization. And what do those countries have? They have xenophobia. They have laws that make it difficult for a foreigner to become a citizen.

America's history dates back to Europe's traditions. Recall that in Europe there are many small countries that have fought a lot of wars against one another but have in recent times chosen a more peaceful coexistence. But America also represented with a break with some of those traditions. At least momentarily.

You seem to be a fan of Ben Carson. Ben Carson is an oddity as far as Republicans go. Even you have more praise for Trump in your stump.

America is living this "push back" against changes as represented by the left. Coal mines are failing due to climate change concerns? Blame the left. Cities are making life boring?

No, Daesh _is_ contained. Here's an [ISIS Sanctuary Map from September](http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISIS%20Sanctuary%2015%20SEPT%202015.pdf), and here's [one from June](http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISIS-Sanctuary%20June%2019%202015_2.png). Not much change. We're mainly helping the Kurds, the ISF, and the Iraqi Army do it themselves.

Here's the one from [October of last year](http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISIS%20Sanctuary%20Map%20Oct%2030%2C%202014.pdf). Comparing to June, you can see they gained that central portion of Syria. But Syria is not our bailiwick, Iraq is.

We've been giving air support in Syria anyway, mainly in support of the Kurds, who are in eastern Syria, but we don't have a mandate to go further in towards Damascus, because we don't have boots on the ground. "Our" boots in the east are the Kurds. In the west it's the FSA or something, but we don't have anyone in the center.

Russia, on the other hand, has been invited into Syria by Assad, so they have Assad's "boots", that's who they're giving air support for, both against the FSA and against Daesh. France is going in because they've apparently recognized Daesh as a state that has levied an act of war against them. They're just bombing for the heck of it, I guess they're probably helping the Russians and Assad.

Some have claimed Russia also has boots on the ground in Syria, but there's no evidence of that, as far as I can tell.</Comment><Comment author="CarsonOrSanders" date="1448083467.0" date_utc="1448054667.0" id="cx7byfu" parent_id="t1_cx7btxa" type="reply">&gt;No, Daesh is contained.

There was an article the other day about several defectors from ISIS and according to them most people join ISIS for the pay, not because they are radicalized.

They point out that non ISIS members in ISIS controlled territory are treated very poorly; last in line for food, last in line for medical attention, etc. ISIS members are treated very well, they are given money, their family is well taken care of, etc.

If that's the case (that most join ISIS for money and not for ideology) then the best course of action is to stop ISIS' spread, allow rebels/the government to retake ISIS controlled territory, and to stop the flow of cash to ISIS.

If we stop an airstrike to save the life of one civilian we might actually be condemning the lives of hundreds, possibly thousands.</Comment><Comment author="dirtyfries" date="1448083242.0" date_utc="1448054442.0" id="cx7btef" parent_id="t1_cx7bqvx" type="reply">That's an interesting perspective.

Clinton supports *multipayer*, this means if you can afford insurance you will be forced to buy it and you will be forced to pay extra in taxes to support those who can't. Bush favors multipayer over single payer but the difference between him and Clinton is that he want's to allow the states to implement their own systems (which makes a lot more sense).

Single payer is a single fund set up by the government to pay for all health care. If you want single payer don't vote for Hillary. 

Multipayer puts the burden of health care on the middle class while single payer spreads it more evenly. </Comment><Comment author="Anti_Bullshit" date="1448139616.0" date_utc="1448110816.0" id="cx7xabc" parent_id="t1_cx7x3pn" type="reply">&gt; Trump and Sanders do though.

Meanwhile these hardline leftists are completely dumb to the real reason why Bill Clinton governed as a moderate Democrat just as they were still dumb when Obama started doing the same thing: this is how a liberal President in a virulently conservative era must govern, through triangulation.  

There's freakin' books about the subject and the politicos understand it and the political operatives understand it and even a lot of the media understands it but those in the 90s and today with the Bernie supporters have zero clue about how the political lean of the American people and society actually do wag the tail of the government and the politicians.

How so? Can you offer any proof that Conservatives are any more racist than any other political party? 

 &gt;When people talk about the "party of stupid"

This is a term used by Conservatives to describe the establishment wing of the GOP. It is used to describe RINOs who never follow the will of the GOP voters and follow self defeating policies instead. The term does not mean that the GOP is stupid compared to Democrat policies.

&gt;White Christian nativists.

Wrong. I am an atheist and LEGAL immigration has ALWAYS been a  strength of the USA. What Conservatives oppose is millions of illegal immigrants who will not assimilate, and go on public assistance permanently. We view the Left's immigration policies in the US and the EU as a destructive attempt to flood the country with voters who will vote to make government bigger and more costly. 

&gt;focused their racism agaist the President

Can you provide any proof of that? Conservatives oppose Obama not because he is half black but because we oppose his policies and political philosophy. If Bernie Sanders or Hilary, or John Kerry, or Al Gore were president, we would oppose them just as vigorously. 

&gt;promoted fascism

Fascism is a type of socialism that merged the key elements of socialism with nationalism and racism in the case of the Nazis. The fact that you don't know that really hurts your case here. 

&gt;actively worked to obstruct the improvement of the nation to the detriment of millions of Americans

We oppose Leftist policies! We view the Left as a cancer on the country. "Progressivism" is not a general desire to make the country and lives of the people better. Progressivism is a static, rigid path to classical socialism. </Comment><Comment author="BlueBlazerIrregular" date="1448149316.0" date_utc="1448120516.0" id="cx80voj" parent_id="t1_cx80m67" type="reply">Got it.

And if the answer is-because of same sex marriage, because of increasing civil rights, because of Roe v Wade, because when they want to denigrate others they call it religious freedom but when they feel there is a "war on Xmas" they believe they are being persecuted.  I live in one of the states that article is talking about, a state where some 400,000 people didn't have healthcare until ACA, many of them are the poor or working class whites the article speaks of-so what happened a few weeks ago?  They voted for a new Governor who promises to dismantle the healthcare exchange.
So, I guess ultimately if you feel like a stranger in your own country because people are being treated more fairly, if you feel persecuted in your own country because not everyone thinks and feels exactly as you do, and if you choose to vote against your own interests then perhaps you reap what you sow.  
How many of us, blacks, Latinos, women, gay people, atheists, Jews, Liberals(during the Reagan, Bush I and II years), have felt this way?  And yet when we did we didn't seek to vote for someone who by making our situation better would make others lives worse, we didn't seek to marginalize them, to "register" them, to build a wall.  I have lived among people like this for 20 years and all I can tell you is while I disagree with them about many things, I wish them no harm.

Our government no longer does what is best for the people or for the country to succeed and remain strong. 

The Left lies and claims that anyone who opposes their policies are dumb, racist, anti science, insincere, and basically evil. 

We believe that socialism and Jeffersonian Democracy are incompatible philosophies on government and that the Left only seeks to destroy American culture, power, and moral standing.

These issues go much deeper than any specific issue like gay marriage. It feels as if the entire Left is living in an alternative reality. A reality based on faith that  leftist ideology must be followed religiously, regardless of the facts, objective reality, or logic.

Are you suggesting that the economic collapse during  Bush II's years is what is best for the people and will make this country strong and successful?  For who 1% of the population?

As I said, I live in a state that is by and large a super majority of Republicans.  I do not think they are dumb but I have found many to be anti science, anti-intellectual, and yes I certainly have encountered my fair share of racism, but I do not believe everyone here is racist.

You suggest that it feels like "the entire left" is living in an alternate reality, pray tell what reality is that?  The one where global warming exists, the one where CEO's now make 200-300 times what their average employee makes, the one where a man running for president wants to "register" people based on their religious beliefs, where others running for president attended a conference led by a man who thinks homosexuals should be killed (but first we should give them time to repent), where having a rapist's baby seems a viable option, where we have trillions to spend on war but not enough to care for the soldiers who fought the war, where the price of healthcare leads to some of us having to forgo doctors visits and others to be incapable of purchasing the medicine they need??? Is this some alternate reality? Because if it is find me the door to "actual reality" and I will make my exit.

You believe socialism is incompatible with Jeffersonian democracy?  Is Social Security incompatible? Is Medicare incompatible?  Is the public school system incompatible? Is the interstate highway system incompatible?  These are all socialist programs and as far as I can tell they have done nothing but make this country stronger and it's people safer.

A socialist democratic country and a socialist country are different entities.  This distinction seems to be lost on many either because they have failed to do their research or because they deliberately wish to obfuscate that fact to scare unwitting people in to believing it will turn this country in Cuba.

You say we "seek to destroy American culture, power and moral standing", how do we do that?  Is it moral to torture people?  Is it moral to deny people rights based on race, national origin, sexuality, religion?  What is American culture if not that this country is, indeed, a melting pot.  A nation built by immigrants who came here with the knowledge that they would get equal opportunity and a fair shake.  Our power does not come from the strength of our military but from the strength of our principles and unless I am mistaken at the core of those principles is a strongly held belief in the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Those rights are not conferred on just a few but on everyone.

Our so-called "faith" is not in "leftist ideology".  It is based on what we see and what we see is that the system is only working for a mere few of us and so we seek to correct that.  To me that is moral, and to me the culture and power of America is only as strong as how we treat the weakest amoung us.</Comment><Comment author="syncopator" date="1448148422.0" date_utc="1448119622.0" id="cx80h1x" parent_id="t1_cx8022a" type="reply">Yes, those "leftist" policies are designed to destroy the country just like they did back in the 1950's when the Republican Party introduced them.

The "ARMED GUARDS" you are referring to are trained guards, for the most part. Secret Service - despite their recent exploits - are trained by elite teachers about being responsible for who to target, what to look out for, etc. 

The usual vox populi - of which I often hear "pro-gun" people state should be armed at any time - are not required to be trained. They are often able to buy a weapon without any expectation of responsibility. Training is optional. And that's the point of it all and why your all caps "ARMED GUARDS" rings hollow to me. 

After all, the 2nd Amendment states: 

&gt; "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

What the "pro-gun" lobby loves to harp on is the bits after "free State." I'm all for people being given the opportunity to own a weapon, but not without being registered and trained. Simple as that. 

The "pro-gun" lobby can cry #notallgunowners are bad or some contrived crap like that, but the truth of the matter is that it doesn't matter. I don't know that gun owner from Adam. Is he a threat? Is he competent when using a firearm?

Or is he/she going to get pissed off when someone takes their parking spot: http://abc7.com/news/20-year-old-mother-killed-in-victorville-over-parking-space/775791/

when someone feels "threatened by loud music:" http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/florida-man-life-prison-killing-teen-loud-music-article-1.1978021

or throwing popcorn at them in a movie theater: http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/11/us/movie-theater-shooter-released-on-bond/

Americans love to be not responsible for things and this recent crop of gun owners are the living embodiment of that. You have a responsibility - based on the Founding Fathers - to be responsible with your weapon and not whine about people who don't like the fact that you can buy it without any real oversight. </Comment><Comment author="Fargonian" date="1448069222.0" date_utc="1448040422.0" id="cx72nqv" parent_id="t1_cx6zg8w" type="reply">&gt;The "pro-gun" lobby can cry #notallgunowners are bad or some contrived crap like that, but the truth of the matter is that it doesn't matter.

I have seen enough of human nature in my life to know that owning a weapon is a deep responsibility that the majority of people take seriously, and a smaller number that believes they should just possess it without any further follow up. Just as I trust the majority of those with medical licenses, the majority of contractors, the majority of drivers, etc. 

Look, I'm not big on the anti-gun lobby either. If anyone claims that removing all guns is the solution then they are being just as specious. I think that the solution - if one can be found - lies somewhere in the middle. I find the pendulum swing of "we need to arm more people" to be the wrong response.  </Comment><Comment author="Fargonian" date="1448085192.0" date_utc="1448056392.0" id="cx7d0hg" parent_id="t1_cx7cci5" type="reply">That's fair, but that being said, I think "We should allow the right people to be armed more than they are" is absolutely acceptable. Compromises like CCW in schools/college campuses with some specific training requirement, and background checks allowing the end-user to access the NICS system instead of going through FFL dealers are great middle-ground solution that the extremists of both sides would scoff at.</Comment><Comment author="PM_What_You_Learned" date="1448086594.0" date_utc="1448057794.0" id="cx7duao" parent_id="t1_cx7d0hg" type="reply">I can definitely get behind that.

Likewise, the idea that we need to pass blatantly unconstitutional laws without first revoking the 2nd and 4th amendments.

"Rationale" means "a set of reasons or a logical basis for a course of action or a particular belief". Kerry is 100% correct that ISIS had a rationale for the Charlie Hebdo attacks. All that means is that they had reasons for it, as to opposed to it just being some random thing.

A "rationalization" is an attempt to justify something.

Recognizing that there is a rationale to something does not imply an attempt to rationalize that thing.

In two months, 440,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to death camps.

To survive, George, then a teenager, collaborated with the Nazis.

First he worked for the Judenrat. That was the Jewish council set up by the Nazis to do their dirty work for them. Instead of the Nazis rounding up Jews every day for the trains, they delegated that murderous task to Jews who were willing to do it to survive another day at the expense of their neighbours.

Theodore hatched a better plan for his son. He bribed a non-Jewish official at the agriculture ministry to let George live with him. George helped the official confiscate property from Jews.

By collaborating with the Nazis, George survived the Holocaust. He turned on other Jews to spare himself.</Comment><Comment author="Logical_Hare" date="1448105856.0" date_utc="1448077056.0" id="cx7nhvg" parent_id="t1_cx7nd52" type="reply">...and according to the internet, Glenn Beck raped and murder a young girl in 1990.

Sometimes in interviews the facts can get a little muddled. He went along on one appraisal and took no part in the process itself (this was left behind property btw, not stuff being taken directly from people or anything like that). He feels no guilt about it because he didn't do anything himself, and even if he had helped with the appraisal it was just another job that someone else would have done.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="LIBERTYRIGHT" date="1448136626.0" date_utc="1448107826.0" id="3toohl" num_total_comments="71" num_true_comments="70" title="Liberalism isn't intellectual. Its only purpose is to exploit a resource excess in our society." type="post">Liberalism isn't intellectual. Its only purpose is to exploit a resource excess in our society. : In r/K Selection Theory in Evolutionary Ecology, if you provide a population with free resources, those who will come to dominate the population will exhibit five basic traits, called an r-selected Reproductive Strategy. These traits are all designed to best exploit the free resource availability. In nature, the r-selected strategy is best seen in the rabbit, which lives in fields of grass it will never fully consume. The five traits are, competition and risk avoidance, promiscuity, low-investment single parenting, earlier age of sexualization of young, and no loyalty to in-group. These traits are ultimately designed to selfishly maximize the numbers of offspring produced. Each of these offspring, though of lesser fitness, will be able to survive and reproduce freely themselves, due to the free resource availability. In r-selection nobody ends up dead, and killing or being killed is not a concern.

In r/K Theory, there is also a strategy exactly opposite to the rabbit's, which emerges under conditions of resource scarcity. It is called the K-selected Reproductive Strategy. There, where resources are scarce, competition for resources is everywhere, and some individuals will die due to failure in competition, and the resultant resource denial that this produces. This produces the K-strategy, which is best seen in the wolf. This strategy also has five psychological traits - competitiveness/aggressiveness/protectiveness, mate monopolization/monogamy, high-investment two-parent child-rearing, later age of sexualization of young, and high loyalty to in-group. This psychology is designed to form highly fit and competitive groups that succeed in group competition, all while capturing and monopolizing the fittest mate possible, as a means of making their offspring genetically fitter than those of competitors. Here, the goal is not to simply consume as much as possible yourself and produce as many baby-making machines as you can, with little regard to their fitness. Here, the goal is to help your group succeed in its competition for the scarce resources, and then produce offspring of as high a fitness as possible, so they may carry your genes forward by succeeding in competition themselves. It is obvious why every r-strategy ideal would act as a repellent to a K-strategist, since each ideal would guarantee failure in the K-selected environment.

A concept in biology which postulates that nature will tend to produce two different psychologies, each adapted to a specific environment. It states that animals which are competitive and protective of family, sexually selective and monogamous, imbued with regard for two parent family life, desirous that offspring wait until mature to mate, and loyal to in-group are designed to produce highly fit and competitive offspring, designed to compete in an environment of resource scarcity.

Animals that exhibit a cowardly nature, promiscuous mating strategy, single parenting style, early sexualization of young, and no loyalty to in-group are designed to exploit a resource glut by producing as many offspring as possible, as fast as possible, without regard to offspring quality.

Wolves are a quintessential K-strategist species. Wolves are competitive and protective, because they must fight for food to survive. They carefully select the fittest mate, and monopolize that fit mate, so that their offspring will be as genetically fit as possible, relative to peers. They embrace two-parent family values, as offspring are reared carefully in a loving and supportive pack/family environment, so they will have the best chance of succeeding themselves in their own competitions. They do not allow offspring to mate until mature and proven in competition, so any immaturity will not lead to their offspring securing sub-par monogamous mates. Finally, they develop a strong pack-loyalty to maximize the chances of their pack's competitive success, and by extension, their own. Males evolve to be courageous and strong as they set out to provision the family and absorb any risk, while females carefully nurture offspring back at the den.

Rabbits are quintessential r-strategists. Rabbits live in fields of grass they never fully exhaust. Their goal is to produce as many offspring as quickly as possible. They flee from danger, because to fight for food that they can get elsewhere is an unnecessary risk. They mate promiscuously with any mate, because their goal is solely to reproduce, absent concerns for genetic quality - when resources are everywhere, even the most defective offspring can find food, mate, and pass genes forward. While males are off mating as often as possible, females raise offspring alone, and quickly send them on their way to whelp a new litter. Offspring begin having sex early, to maximize numbers of their own offspring. Loyalty to in-group is unknown to the rabbit, because there is no competition for resources, since resources are everywhere. Among r-strategists, males will tend to exhibit smaller, more feminine, less robust physical qualities, to better facilitate fleeing and showy displays of flash and beauty, to facilitate mate attraction, and mating. r-strategist females, by contrast will tend to grow big, assertive, and ill-tempered, to better occupy a more masculine family role, provisioning and protecting the offspring they raise alone.

Liberalism isn't intellectual. It is merely the rabbit's r-selected Reproductive Strategy, intellectualized in humans who exhibit it instinctually. Its only purpose is to exploit a resource excess in our society.

Actually, we're not as captalist as we used to be. The govt controls nearly every aspect of our economic lives and manipulates the economy for it's own desired results.

&gt;In capitalism and in biology there's nothing wrong with self interest. Its what drives basically everything.

I agree.  I favor the wolf.

How many have gun owners killed here just this year in the US? By your logic any number over 120 is enough. Now, maybe you don't see every gun owner as being the same. Well, guess what, others don't see all 'muslims' as the same either. Here is something for YOU to read now (from elsewhere on reddit this morning):

There's a book called Heroes: Mass Murder And Suicide by a guy named Franco Berardi, which is about exactly what the title says it is about. He talks about the Aurara movie theater shootings, Anders Breivik, Columbine, ect. The common thread behind all these acts of mass murder is that the perpetrators feel lonely, alienated, and humiliated. They feel like losers, and like what the world expects of them is something they will never be able to provide.


So they turn their inner pain outwards. They become bitter, they latch on to anything that can give them a sense of purpose or meaning. They invent myths of themselves as these holy, wonderful, beings fighting against the evil and stupidity of the rest of the world. A lot of acts of mass murder are really acts of suicide by proxy in a way. They want to express their contempt for the society that dragged them down to such a low place. They want to leave a mark that says "I existed"
If you look at the backstory of a lot of westerners who go to fight for ISIS it's the same story. Alienation, poverty, histories of drug abuse or mental illness. Generally miserable lives by people on the fringes, either socially or mentally.


ISIS is appealing to these people because it's telling them they are great, that they are wonderful, and that it is everybody else who is horrible, not them.
Really everybody should read that book I mentioned.

Here's an interview with the author[1]

*The frequency of psychopathology is on the rise. You see, my book is also an attempt to find a possibility of understanding the spreading suicide of terror, the kind of acts that are currently being committed by the Islamic State, for example. This kind of phenomenon... I don't think we can possibly describe it only in terms of ideological or religious beliefs.*

*Of course these religious and political beliefs do exist and are important factors, but I believe that the deeper, more universal motivation of these acts is suffering. Because you just can't understand a young person coming from London and going to Syria to kill and be killed only on the basis of their religious beliefs. We have to try to understand their humiliation.... we have to try to understand what kind of hell is inside this person.*

It definitely isn't limited to one particular side.

As for this post, people are neither rabbits nor wolves. We're vastly more complicated. There are so many more factors in our lives than food and mating.

Any resource, when not priced sufficiently, will be over exploited by the community, and ultimately used up or otherwise wrecked.

This is as true with regards to health care or college education as with grazing land.  

There are only a couple of options to prevent this from occurring:  Price resources appropriately to encourage conservation and stewardship, or give rationing authority to some body (government) to enforce conservation and stewardship.

Allowing the market to value resources seems to many of us the most reasonable means.  The drive for revenue will encourage pricing that brings in the greatest number of "customers", while the drive for profit drives rationing based on the ability to pay, which also preserves the long term viability of the resource, since its owner would not want to deplete the resource below the point that it can no longer be exploited for more revenue and profit.

Of course, whomever is excluded from participation due to inability to pay may feel that is unfair.  They may even think its unethical (in the case of health care and food).  They would prefer authoritative rationing to market rationing, because then people are excluded on the basis of central planning and individual luck, not on their access to economic resources.

Allowing authorities to ration seems basically dangerous to many of us.  The authorities can be driven by moral corruption or bias in a way markets are not.  The idea of moving from a system in which we can (have the hope of, the ability to) attain resources and provide for ourselves, to a system in which we must passively wait for the system to allocate resources to us is soul crushing and dystopian.  Add to that the fact that the same people who would have paid for services under the price rationing system are still paying under the authoritative system (indirectly, and without securing title or access for themselves), and you might see why those who can currently access essential services under the pricing model aren't excited about moving to an authoritative one.</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="PCisLame" date="1448094389.0" date_utc="1448065589.0" id="3tmvcb" num_total_comments="37" num_true_comments="37" title="In denouncing Republicans as &#8220;scared of widows and orphans&#8221; and castigating those who prefer Christian refugees to Muslims coming to America, Barack Obama has come off as petulant and unpresidential." type="post">In denouncing Republicans as &#8220;scared of widows and orphans&#8221; and castigating those who prefer Christian refugees to Muslims coming to America, Barack Obama has come off as petulant and unpresidential. : <Comments><Comment author="Another-Chance" date="1448095102.0" date_utc="1448066302.0" id="cx7iegt" parent_id="t3_3tmvcb" type="comment">Hard to take anything you say seriously when that is your source.

**Muslim world does not share these values and rejoices whenever westerners are murdered in Jihad:**

Well, let's see here - Americans cheer the death of people in the middle east all the time. They send care packages to troops (like some did with my son), pray for them, celebrate them - all the while they are carrying out wars on people who aren't a threat to us. 

So it is only an "American value" when someone else doesn't do it? Have you ever, once, tried to see things from another point of view to try to understand broader issues?

In this case it is the process by which a group's language and/or culture come to resemble those of another group.

&gt;Terrorist breeding grounds: what does that mean? Both of those things - terrorist and breeding ground for them.

In this case the terrorists are radical Sunni Muslims sympathetic to ISIS. The breeding grounds for these terrorists are closed off Muslim-only communities in Europe, like Molenbeek cited in the article, which serve as a relatively safe space for terror cells to operate. 

&gt;Americans cheer the death of people in the middle east all the time. They send care packages to troops (like some did with my son), pray for them, celebrate them - all the while they are carrying out wars on people who aren't a threat to us.

The American people didn't want us intervening in the Middle East until ISIS burst on to the scene and started killing everybody. And the international community now understands that creating ISIS was a policy decision on the part of Obama, so we need to give the American people some time to catch up with these recent developments, which they are doing in spite of concerted efforts by the mainstream media and the White House to keep them in the dark.

Well, that little tidbit for one.

First off, calling it 'Obamaworld' is just petty and stupid - but it plays well in the minds of the weak (it shakes off real information and replaces it with a dog whistle - which is fine in some instances when talking to trolls, but writing an article? Yeah. No.)

There is no real definition of who "Us" is and who "Them" are. "Us" is trying to be inclusive to something but that something isn't defined in any real way. 

&gt; According to the Wall Street Journal, after the Paris attacks, &#8220;French security forces &#8230; conducted hundreds of anti-terror raids and placed more than 100 suspects under arrest. &#8230; France has some 11,500 names on government watch lists.&#8221; How many of those 11,500 are of Arab descent or the Muslim faith?

And...so? Who has killed more here in the US and attacked more here? Christians who own guns or muslims? Were McVeigh or Koresh muslim? The guy who shot up a theater, church, school (several of those) muslim?

When you read through his dribble he is trying to define a threat - one which we were told we would stop with our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. And a threat we heard little about prior to fall of the Soviet Union. 

He makes this about religion - when it is obviously not. </Comment><Comment author="jpurdy" date="1448097376.0" date_utc="1448068576.0" id="cx7jj3v" parent_id="t3_3tmvcb" type="comment">Patrick Buchanan on World Nuts Daily. Right.

Why aren't Republicans acknowledging and supporting that Obama is fighting terrorist forces that wouldn't exist if not for the insane invasion of Iraq? </Comment><Comment author="Scooby489" date="1448094555.0" date_utc="1448065755.0" id="cx7i4sb" parent_id="t3_3tmvcb" type="comment">I would say he's been more presidential, considering that it is against the constitution to deny the refugees, and even more so to force them to take a religious test!</Comment><Comment author="Brett_Hughes_FHRiley" date="1448096299.0" date_utc="1448067499.0" id="cx7izw6" parent_id="t1_cx7i4sb" type="reply">Middle aged men fleeing their country instead of fighting for it aren't refugees they're cowards.

If you'd rather forsake these families because you're too scared they could be this Trojan horse scenario, then isis has already won. As for them middle aged men, what side would you prefer they fight for? Their country is a damn disaster, but it's easier calling them all cowards as for the reasoning to forsake them.
