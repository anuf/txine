I'm getting my PhD in Physics (experimental nanomagnetism/ spintronics) so I'll give my best shot at explaining what this means.

Quantum entanglement occurs when you can precisely align two particles in just the right way (that's not to say it can't occur randomly in nature).   In this case we are talking about electrons.  Theoretically, you can entangle any property of two particles.  Practically, we do this with spin.  Spin is the property of electrons which is effectively a little bar magnet which can either be pointed up or down.  North on top South on bottom or vice versa.  

We can entangle the spin of two electrons, but it is very difficult to do at room temperature because there's a lot of heat.  Heat causes things to jiggle around so aligning things (entangling the particles) is very tough.

When two particles are entangled and their spin is measured you immediately know what the spin of the other particle will be when measured.  It could be on the other side of the universe and you would be able to know it's spin.  This is impressive because normally the laws of quantum mechanics forbid knowing the spin of something before it is measured.  

From a practical stand point the ability to do this will help with quantum computers as qbits require a similar preparation required by the electrons in the above article.  Unfortunately instant long distance communication via this method is theoretically impossible, but that's another post.

Edit: Additional info by request

Why you can't transfer information is a little weird to explain, because there is something happening; the state of the particles are unknown before being measured. And that something is one of the biggest questions in physics.
In terms of information transfer though, imagine I have a bag with a red and blue marble in it. Without looking, I take one of the marbles and place it in another bag. It is impossible to know which marble is in either bag in this experiment. You go to one end of the universe and I go to the other. When I see I have a blue marble, I know you have a red one. No actual information is transferred because all the information was "transferred" when we put the marbles in the bags.

Experimentally it's been shown that these particles really are in quantum states: we can not know what either one of them is doing until after they've been measured. But more importantly the state of one particle has been shown to effect the state of the other particle. Back to the marble analogy, imagine if I could pull the blue marble out of the bag in a special way which would cause your marble to have a 50/50 chance of being now being either yellow or orange. This is that "something".

All of this has been experimentally proven pretty thoroughly via Bells theorem experiments (which I am not explaining cause I'm hella lazy).</Comment><Comment author="wothy" date="1448110622.0" date_utc="1448081822.0" id="cx7pi96" parent_id="t1_cx7oye4" type="reply">Could you please explain why instant long distance communication is theoretically impossible?

If you were to bring both papers into your possession, you could verify that they are in fact quantum entangled. Once this fact is established, you can take the papers anywhere and be certain of the other's status just by checking one of them.

They're in superposition, which means two realities exist where the particles have opposite properties.

In other words, by measuring you find out which one of the realities you are in, and this give you information about both particles, even though one of them can be far away.

Two space ships meet and entangle a pair of electrons.  Each ship takes one half of the pair.  They want to meet up at at one of two secret location on either side of a great distance in 100 years.  To prevent enemies knowing where they are meeting they agree that in 100 years they will measure the entangled electrons.  If the measurement is "north" they meet at location A.  If the measurement is "south" they meet at location B.

The ships separate in opposite directions.  100 years passes and the light distance between them is great.  Each ship makes a measurement and instantaneously receive the same answer regardless of the distance between them.  Both ships turn toward the same chosen location even though they couldn't know that choice FTL without entanglement.

Imagine you have two quarters, Q1 and Q2(Two particles). Now imagine that when you flip one(50/50 chance to land on heads or tails) what ever it lands on the other will always land on that side as well. So, lets say Q1 lands on heads. Now you know that Q2 will land on heads. 

Now apply that to the situation above. You wait x amount of time and travel y amount of distance. Lets say you are on the ship with Q2. You flip your quarter and it lands on tails this time. Well, now you know what Q1 will land as. You can now make your decision to go to location b.

Edit: It is important to note that you cannot use this more than once.

The usual explanation is that in order for two separated ships to notice that their measurements were entangled at all, they'd have to come back together (at less than the speed of light) and say "Hey, yeah, in this random stream of 1's and 0's, whenever I get a 1, you get a 0. How interesting." Before that, each will simply see a random stream of 1's and 0's.

In the example /u/somewhat_pragmatic gives, they meet in advance, and in a sense that information is carried out with them as they travel (again, at less than the speed of light) to their waiting spots.</Comment><Comment author="onewhitelight" date="1448112812.0" date_utc="1448084012.0" id="cx7qdyd" parent_id="t1_cx7qadn" type="reply">But no information is transferred.

It's somewhat "worse" than that; relativity requires that 'who measured first' doesn't even have any meaning.

A useful search term would be Hardy's test of local realism. I was fortunate enough to conduct the experiment [seen here](https://wiki.umn.edu/MXP/SinglePhotonEntanglement) in the summer of 2014. The theory tends to get murky every time I try to explain it. Fortunately, my partner made an [explanation sheet](https://wiki.umn.edu/pub/MXP/SinglePhotonEntanglement/VennDiagramofBeckObservations.pdf) that does reasonable job at avoiding the confusing terminology present in many papers.

Early in the days of quantum mechanics, behavior was observed that could not be explain classically. Physicists tried to explain this behaviour with [hidden variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory). Try reading up on the [Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox). This paradox remained unsolved for a long time. A mathematician by the name of John Bell was able to come up with a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) which made predictions which would differ between a classical hidden variables, and a quantum result. For many years experiments failed to use Bell's inequality because experimental errors make an inequality hard to test. Lucien Hardy was able to setup a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%27s_paradox) that would give an all or nothing test of local realism. Local Realism predicts that a certain outcome would never happen. Which makes experiments much easier because, then if you were to observe that event even once, it would disprove local realism. Of course the nature of experiments makes that less straightforward than a single observation. In some experiments the tested occurrence happens by chance, so the result is measured with an occurrence that is statistically significantly higher than random.

I fear that any more attempt at explanation on my part will result in further obfuscation, but there are a number of papers describing these experiments, some of which have been designed to be conducted at an undergraduate level.</Comment><Comment author="Atlanticall" date="1448111125.0" date_utc="1448082325.0" id="cx7ppno" parent_id="t1_cx7hyb4" type="reply">ELI5 version: it's like two people trying to communicate with one another by listening to the same radio station.

I'm getting my PhD in Physics (experimental nanomagnetism/ spintronics) so I'll give my best shot at explaining what this means.

Quantum entanglement occurs when you can precisely align two particles in just the right way (that's not to say it can't occur randomly in nature).   In this case we are talking about electrons.  Theoretically, you can entangle any property of two particles.  Practically, we do this with spin.  Spin is the property of electrons which is effectively a little bar magnet which can either be pointed up or down.  North on top South on bottom or vice versa.  

We can entangle the spin of two electrons, but it is very difficult to do at room temperature because there's a lot of heat.  Heat causes things to jiggle around so aligning things (entangling the particles) is very tough.

When two particles are entangled and their spin is measured you immediately know how the spin of the other particle will be measured.  It could be on the other side of the universe and you would be able to know it's spin.  

From a practical stand point the ability to do this will help with quantum computers as qbits require a similar preparation to the electrons I just described.  Unfortunately instant long distance communication via this method is theoretically impossible, but that's another post.</Comment><Comment author="Adius_Omega" date="1448110542.0" date_utc="1448081742.0" id="cx7ph5a" parent_id="t1_cx7oy8d" type="reply">So rhetorically speaking if you could entangle two singular electrons and then seperate them 1 light year away, by doing something with one, the other one 1 light year away would instantly do the same and essentially bypass the speed of light?

No actual information travels but it can be conveyed if we can observe or measure a change in those entangled particles, can it not?

This doesn't really matter. The reason people are so against FTL, beyond just the claims of relativity, is that relativity implies an equivalence between FTL signaling and time travel.

If I have a mostly flat spacetime with a wormhole connecting distant points, there is a reference frame in the larger spacetime where one end of the wormhole is much farther in the past than the other. Travel through two of them in succession, so that the mouths of an individual wormhole are spatially separated but that one wormhole is temporally before the other and you can hit your own past timeline. Take mouth 1 of wormhole A back in time to mouth 2. Travel normally to mouth 1 of wormhole B, get spit out at mouth 2 which is near where/when mouth 1A will later be. Travel to the time and location of mouth 1A and you have a temporal cycle. 

Moving faster than light in one frame is *equivalent* to time travel in another reference frame. There is no need to "use it" for time travel in the sense that requires an extra step; by travelling through the wormhole at all there is a valid description where you've done exactly that.

----------------------

Wormholes are solutions of general relativity, but general relativity mathematically *allows* time travel through mechanisms like these (You can declare *any* smooth geometry you want if you don't put any constraints on what the spacetime contains). However it would create a lot of extra problems and always seems to involve very unrealistic features of the energy density so they're expected to not exist. There are some mathematical conjectures related to nailing that down, but I don't think anything has been comprehensively established yet.</Comment><Comment author="metanat" date="1448108374.0" date_utc="1448079574.0" id="cx7okyg" parent_id="t1_cx7cgzs" type="reply">&gt;However, entanglement is an observable fact that goes directly against the basic fundament of the theory of relativity.

"goes directly against the basic fundament (sp) of the theory of relativity" is an overstatement IMO.

The theory of relativity and specifically simultaneity simply doesn't encompass "quantum information"; it's couched in classical terms and in classical terms, entanglement arguably manifests as just a statistical improbability (by which I mean the behaviour captured by Bell's theorem).

Wavefunction collapse is not a classical event in space-time, and relativity just has nothing to say about it.

You have a box with a red ball and a blue ball.

Without looking, you take one of the balls and put it into another box.

Now no matter where you are in the universe you can send 1 bit of data to the person who has the other box! Just by opening your box you know what color the ball is in the other box, so you have instantly sent a bit of data to the other box determining its color. All you need is 8 of these devices and you can send an entire byte of information.</Comment><Comment author="my_fokin_percocets" date="1448098392.0" date_utc="1448069592.0" id="cx7k0vw" parent_id="t1_cx7bo4x" type="reply">No..you know what color the other bit is but you have sent anything.

Give the boxes to two people and have one drive to New York and one to California. When the first person gets to New York have them open the box. Based on whether that person finds the right shoe or the left shoe, they instantly know which shoe the second person has. 

Can you use this to communicate faster than light? No, because the first person and they second person aren't communicating with each other, they're both communicating with you. And the information being communicated (which shoe is in which box) is moving at the speed of the car, which is far less than the speed of light.

So what makes quantum entanglement cool and weird? As an example, you can entangle electrons so that one has positive spin and one has negative spin - just like separating a pair of shoes, one of which is a left shoe and one of which is a right shoe. The cool and weird part is that until one person looks into their box (measures the spin of their electron) neither electron has positive spin and neither electron has negative spin - both are in a superposition of both spin types. But once the spin of one electron is measured, the wave function of the second electron immediately collapses to reflect the alternative spin. Cool and weird? Yes. Getting one over on Einstein? No.</Comment><Comment author="Micr0waveMan" date="1448098886.0" date_utc="1448070086.0" id="cx7k98o" parent_id="t1_cx7bo4x" type="reply">I think this is the most eli5 way I've ever heard to explain why entanglement can't send info faster than light.

But as I understand that is not something we expect or could do, right?

The spooky action of measuring the spin of entangled particles doesn't seem "problematic" as they're both part of the same original light cone.

As I see it, the misconception is that people are equating instant knowledge of distant systems to instant manipulation of distant systems.

The spooky part is that systems behave differently depending on how much you know about them, so one interpretation is that you can change something far away from you instantly (and even retro-actively) by measuring it. A good example is when gravitational lensing bends the path of light around a galaxy. If you point a telescope at it and check which path a photon took around the galaxy you record a particle that only took one path, however if your recording device only records incidence and not direction, then you record a wave that took both paths. So the way you measure the photon changes both the path it took and the form it took billions of years ago as it traveled across vast expanses of the universe. You essentially can change billions of years of history.

The thing is, that's only possible from your perspective, and so long as nothing else interacts with that photon. As soon as you try to build a system whereby the fate of the galaxy depends on how you measure an incoming photon, what you actually end up measuring is the result of the fate of the galaxy which already played out before the photon gets to you.</Comment><Comment author="Dunder_Chingis" date="1448111083.0" date_utc="1448082283.0" id="cx7pp0i" parent_id="t3_3tllus" type="comment">Oh god, what if we're all entangled from birth?

In fact, fundamentally, wouldn't the satisfaction simply be if you're having sex as much as you want to be? With most people wanting more frequent sex, but also with some of those people getting stuck with less sexual partners, you'd end up with a graph just like that. Especially the S.D increase as you have a higher chance of being disappointed by your partner.

Anecdotally, I've been much much happier in relationships with very low sexual frequency, but only when my partner agrees.

Suddenly I see every problem in my life for the insignificant nonsense it really is, and I stay in a good mood for days afterwards.</Comment><Comment author="chanilastname" date="1448092947.0" date_utc="1448064147.0" id="cx7hbec" parent_id="t1_cx79lsz" type="reply">Not necessarily a male thing I become miserable if I have to go more than a week. </Comment><Comment author="PC__LOAD__LETTER" date="1448103470.0" date_utc="1448074670.0" id="cx7mek7" parent_id="t1_cx79lsz" type="reply">I think I'm actually the opposite of that.

Going without sex makes me "hungry" in a lot of aspects of life. I'm more outgoing, aggressive, confident, proactive. It's only when I'm regularly getting sex that I become complacent, lethargic, and lazy.

It kind of make sense from a biological perspective; if someone who generally considers themself a virile individual isn't getting sex, it would follow that they would exhibit a more attractive nature, which often coorellates with confidence and extraversion. On the other hand, if one is regularly getting sex, it would make sense that they might be completely satisfied biologically and less likely to take unnecessary risks or reach outside of their comfort zone. After all, they're already fulfilling their biological imperative.

I think it's this *awareness* that you will definitely have sex this week with someone you love/like, without having to go into much effort to get it, that keeps the stress and worry that a lack of sex can cause at bay. Research has shown over and over that simply living with an SO makes you far healthier than otherwise, and i think this too is based almost exclusively on the awareness of easy access to intimacy. That you know that you *will* have sex soon again.

Like some other people here have stated, my own desire set point is a lot higher than once a week. But even when i was co-living and having sex even *less* than once a week i still felt a lot better than while being single, where the certainty is gone. I think it's the constant *chase* for intimacy that is the most unhealthy part of not having sex.</Comment><Comment author="raspberrywafer" date="1448103713.0" date_utc="1448074913.0" id="cx7mip6" parent_id="t1_cx7k1v5" type="reply">Someone else brought up the idea of quality, as well, which I agree with. 

Having good quality, satisfying sex once a week with someone who really makes an effort is probably going to be better than lame sex three times a week. 

I also feel like I can enjoy physical intimacy with my SO even if there's no sex. We cuddle, kiss, etc. on a nightly basis, even if we're not having sex every night.

The study is just suggesting diminished returns after once a week, not no returns. Also, happiness in the relationship is one measurement. Did they measure stress levels? How easily irritated they are? Work life? Fulfillment? Etc. 

I know if I hit a third day without sex my employees become significantly more irritating. I'm less relaxed, I'm less perceptive, and more likely to become distracted. I also become increasingly more aggressive. Now, none of this really has an effect on my happiness with my home life...but the added benefits of more sex definitely increase everybody around me's satisfaction in their work lives. </Comment><Comment author="innerknowing" date="1448097136.0" date_utc="1448068336.0" id="cx7jeup" parent_id="t3_3tkvfz" type="comment">What comes first, the sex, or the happiness?</Comment><Comment author="RonyTheTiger" date="1448104378.0" date_utc="1448075578.0" id="cx7mtqp" parent_id="t3_3tkvfz" type="comment">The study also showed that given the choice between more money and more sex, couples would opt for more sex.

One is to take anti-inflammatory supplements.  One that makes you feel amazing if you have inflammation of the gut is s.boulardii combined with kombucha (which contains s. boulardii).  This yeast is highly anti-inflammatory and will cause your stomach to get very flat and provides a lot of benefits.  I feel absolutely amazing while doing it, and I wouldn't do it very long term but maybe a couple times per year.  Other anti-inflammatory supplements include fermented cod liver oil, flax oil, cinnamon, etc. and these in general make you feel pretty good also.  

For many, inflammation can be related to dehydration and if you can get properly hydrated, then you should feel a bit better vs, dehydrated.  For some people its hard to get fully hydrated and thus they develop inflammation.  This can also relate to bodily ph, meaning if you are dehydrated, you are acidic, and when you are acidic, you break down.  Also known as acidosis as a medical term.  Coffee consumption causes inflammation and is acidic.

Stress is another one that affects all of these and things like meditation, acupuncture, and tai chi can basically relieve this.</Comment><Comment author="Thomasne1995" date="1448140631.0" date_utc="1448111831.0" id="cx7xlfj" parent_id="t1_cx7t86v" type="reply">No anti inflammatory supplements.

It reduces inflammation and is suspected to be neuroprotective. Basically you cut carbohydrates as much as possible, and get most of your calories from fat, keeping protein to moderate levels. It might also be effective at fighting some cancers, since some cancer cells are only able to consume glucose, which is much less available in a keto-adapted person.

During my last major depressive episode I realized that it was probably cheese that is causing my depression. I've had a suspicion that cheese affected me negatively, but I never made such a strong correlation before. I had been eating more cheese than normal during september and october, and my depression had gotten so bad I even posted to /suicidewatch. But I noticed a big spike in my symptoms after eating a pizza and it hit me that the effect of cheese might be more powerful than I initially realized. So I quit cheese again, this time, permanently. The depression was gone in two days and hasn't come back (knock on wood). I don't know for sure if cheese was the cause and I have no way to test it because I'll never eat cheese again.

Some foods affect your healthy gut flora. There's been a lot of studies the show healthy gut flora/bacteria is beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. here's one article I found that seems

The theory I'm using is Fasano's Leaky Gut. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22109896 It makes sense that if gluten or something in cheese is interfering with tight junctions, then it could be making the blood-brain barrier permeable and allowing all sorts of junk into the brain. That approach might be too simplistic so I'll definitely keep looking at developments in gut flora research.

As I read it it's an indirect effect of raised CRP, so increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and 'junk' are not the case.

Raised CRP level in the blood is associated with local or systemic inflammations, and this raised level of CRP seems to mess up your brain. Local (in the gut) and systemic inflammations are often associated with leaking and exposure to endotoxins, coming from particular gram-negative bacteria. If we look at the gut: damaged tight junctions (directly or indirectly) and possibly a response by the gut microbes towards releasing more endotoxins (e.g. shift in composition), could lead to increased permeability with negative effects.

Also, the eating of cheese could be affecting your gut's tryptophan metabolism - which in turn affects your brain's serotonin, regardless of inflammation (reviewed here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432814004768).</Comment><Comment author="Inkthinker" date="1448115270.0" date_utc="1448086470.0" id="cx7raru" parent_id="t1_cx7hkqq" type="reply">Anecdotally, from my most recent visit to a GP, sleep helps.

TMS is really something! But neurochemistry is also just one piece of the pie, and TMS may also be potentially dangerous -- maybe not as dangerous as being anhedonic for ten years but it's also possible that you could eventually induce *other* problems, symptoms as potentially serious as seizures, not-so-positive personality changes, or memory loss. Thus now would be a really awesome time to start all those *other* things you've been thinking about doing that beat depression - meditating, exercising, eating differently, and so on.

A more objective focus on life and sensations in the body.  That song that always made me feel sad seemed to lose its hold, because with meditation it was possible to get a glimpse of that feeling and avoid thoughts popping up. 

Through meditation you're  able to feel  that subtle sensation  before it takes over thoughts - a sort of oh, this again let's move back to reality. Never  far away from a feeling of calmness, or at the very least, knowing it's there eventually . This at one point had me completely rid of anxiety by watching myself and sensations in public . I stopped meditating and it's back. 

The texts say the key is to feel the feeling without reacting and it loses control. Look at it objectively. This takes a while, as you could guess. Living your life being anxious in public isn't going to change quickly. 

I was also, during this time, very serious about meditation. Half an hour daily, ten day courses, and reading every week. Getting back into that, as it really, really changed my life around. Immensely. Now I'm afraid again and all the steps I've made seem to be falling apart. 

Let me know if that makes sense. It might seem almost mystical, is this topic usually does. It's one that interests me that I've moved away from  so here it goes.  Let it rain

Once you notice your attention has strayed and you're lost in thought, simply return your attention to your object. As you do this more and more, you'll go longer and longer without losing focus. For whatever reason, this type of sustained focus can induce deep relaxation, and even euphoria.</Comment><Comment author="Bearded_Axe_Wound" date="1448125844.0" date_utc="1448097044.0" id="cx7u8rb" parent_id="t1_cx7tthh" type="reply">Got a phone and some headphones?

There are a lot of classes of antidepressants that block or stimulate different chemicals in your nervous system. It can take weeks or months of trial and error before a drug makes you feel less "sad," but the effect of motivating you to get out of bed, taking a slight edge off your apathy, and giving you some thought clarity can happen almost right away. So what results is an incredibly depressed, hopeless feeling person who suddenly has a little energy, motivation, and clarity...to kill himself. 

Therapy is a different beast. It's gradual and self-reflective and peer-oriented. You break down habits, learn to trust and make yourself vulnerable. Your brain chemistry might eventually change from it, but it's from a lot of hard work where you're in charge rather than a surprise sucker punch that suddenly floods or drains you system of whatever chemical. </Comment><Comment author="ThreeStringGuitar" date="1448108028.0" date_utc="1448079228.0" id="cx7ofre" parent_id="t1_cx7n3c7" type="reply">What is TMS?

The mechanism of ibuprofen is apparently still unknown. Meanwhile, this study measured CRP as a marker of inflammation, and while ibuprofen does have an effect on lowering CRP levels, it's not clear if the CRP has a causal relationship with depression, or if both depression and chronic inflammation (or at least CRP levels) are caused by something else.

Chronic inflammation is associated with countless diseases, and its causes are...really complex, and not well understood.

That said, unless you have a history of kidney disease in your family, a bit of ibuprofen taken regularly shouldn't hurt, but there may be better ways to get anti-inflammatory effects. Omega-3s are remarkably effective anti-inflammatory agents. Though I'm not sure if there are any studies on risks associated with long-term use of omega-3 supplementation, and that depends partly on the sources, it so far has shown almost exclusively positive effects unless perhaps contraindicated in certain populations (e.g. people already on blood thinners.) </Comment><Comment author="Birk_N_Jerk" date="1448104071.0" date_utc="1448075271.0" id="cx7momk" parent_id="t1_cx7j9j1" type="reply">Naproxen (Aleve) is more of an anti-inflammatory than ibuprofen, and it's easier on the digestive tract.

The SAIDs, Like prednisone, can more effectively reduce inflammation, but long-term supplementation can also damage your tendons and joints, or even lead to adrenal fatigue that would "addict" you to the steroid.

Indeed it's a balance. But it's a balance many people have to strike. I have a rheumatic disease and NSAIDs are my preferred way of handling it. I've tried TNF-alpha inhibitors that are extremely effective for inflammation. They basically shuts off the body's ability to create inflammation. But they also made me very infection prone, since inflammation is an important part of the immune system. So now NSAIDs are my only course of medication and it's working pretty good. You can counter the stomach damage with omeprazol or take a short break while the stomach heals to handle it or lower the dose. I know my primary reason for taking NSAIDs isn't depresstion but just wanted to throw it out there that many people are on NSAIDs for life. 

&gt; or damaging your heart.

Not all NSAIDs right? I know there is some correlation between heart health and COX-2 inhibitors like Arcoxia. But not all NSAIDs are COX-2 inhibitors. If anyone has more info on this I'd love to hear about it.

But there has been so much research published on it and it has been used in Indian medicine for centuries, that I'm more comfortable with this. It is definitely an anti-inflammatory and is recommended for arthritis.

Curcumin is the substance in turmeric that seems to be medically active. I've seen it recommended in multiple places that it is better to take the whole plant (the turmeric) than an isolated component. Ideally you can cook with turmeric and get it that way. Be sure to put black pepper in the food also, as it is necessary for absorption. If you buy a supplement, get one with black pepper extract (piperine).

"Curcumin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities and thus has a potential against various malignant diseases, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and other chronic illnesses. These effects are mediated through the regulation of various transcription factors, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases, and other enzymes. Curcumin exhibits activities similar to recently discovered tumor necrosis factor blockers (e.g., HUMIRA, REMICADE, and ENBREL), a vascular endothelial cell growth factor blocker (e.g., AVASTIN), human epidermal growth factor receptor blockers (e.g., ERBITUX, ERLOTINIB, and GEFTINIB), and a HER2 blocker (e.g., HERCEPTIN)."</Comment><Comment author="lulz" date="1448131863.0" date_utc="1448103063.0" id="cx7vj2m" parent_id="t1_cx7tox1" type="reply">If you just consume curcumin on its own the body tags it and tried to eliminate it.

Nearly everybody uses caffeine, so caffeine could account for the high prevalence of migraine and other primary headaches, and for the high prevalence of depression.

Caffeine relieves caffeine withdrawal symptoms by reversing caffeine withdrawal. That may account for caffeine's ability to relieve migraine episodes.

I have RA, which is an inflammatory disease that effects multiple areas of the body including the brain, and I've noticed a profound change in moods based on how "flared" I am. i.e., on a bad day where my joints hurt, I will also have a much harder time concentrating or enjoying myself (this is also referred to as autoimmune brain fog in certain circles). When I'm getting treatment that works, it's like the fog is lifted and my mood and ability to focus improve greatly. One thing besides arthritis meds and NSAIDs that has helped my inflammation is diet regulation.

You know when you have a wound and it swells up and gets a reddish tint? That's inflammation. It's an intentional reaction from the body as part of the healning process. That's the extreme version of it, it can be more subtle, and it happens internally too, not just on the skin. Another noticable example is when 

Now this is a good thing short term since it facilitates the healing process, but sometimes it sticks around for a long time. Having chronic (long-term) inflamation can cause internal damage and is strongly linked to all kinds of serious diseases.

There are all kinds of substances that has been shown to reduce inflammation, including some common painkillers (ibuprofen), as well as some spices used in indian/asian cuisine. 

So inflammation is a real thing, but are "the quacks" right in saying that doing or eating stuff to reduce it is something you should be doing? This is my personal opinion, but if you're generally healthy, eat well, and exercise regulary, you probably don't have a problem with it to begin with, so it won't make much difference. If you're generally healthy, but don't eat well and exercise, starting to do those will probably help way more. If you actually do have chronic inflammation, just eating some spices isn't going to cut it, something is causing that and you need help from a doctor to identify the cause, and then treat that, instead of just treating the symptom. That said, it probably doesn't hurt anything, and indian/asian food is tasty.

If someone is trying to sell you something that they claim reduce inflammation you should probably be sceptical, chances are they're just taking advantage of the fact that people in general know that inflammation is bad but don't know much else about it. If someone tries to sell you a new-age cure for cancer you probably wouldn't believe them, but that doesn't mean cancer isn't real.

Not hating on the researchers but this isn't really anything new. I had to present a paper to my class on this topic back in 2010. It was a paper of my choosing as the topic hit close to home. If you want to do some more reading this might be a good jumping off point. This isn't the paper that I read back then but it looks like it will lead you on the right path. Hard to do a good literature search on my phone.  TNF-alpha + depression as search terms in pub med/google scholar should get you further.

My business that has taken off and been a success...even deals for 100k+ don't produce the euphoria I used to experience as a kid.

Even Adderall, MDMA and other chemicals related to those don't give me pleasurable feelings anymore, just very awake feelings.

I also think the years of prescription drugs has pretty much fucked everything up.

Not a science person so these are the only few things I can find on google. If doctors or nutritionists can weigh in with more papers, it'd be great.  

Got me thinking about other spices that feature in Indian cooking and I got a hit [here](http://www.valleynaturalfoods.com/newsletter/enhance-your-anti-inflammatory-diet-with-the-right-spices/): 

&gt;The most anti-inflammatory spices include ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne, cardamom, cilantro, garlic, parsley, curry and cumin. 

I've always wondered if issues where parts of your body gets inflamed, like Crohn's, UC, IBS, Celiac disease etc cause depression or if depression causes your body to get inflamed.

Because of homing pigeons.  
They use a complicated direction finding over long distances, but closer to home they unerringly find their way by eyesight.

A similar idea was used in project sea hunt.  

https://www.uscg.mil/history/ops/sar/ProjectSeaHunt/ProjectSeaHuntStudy.pdf  

http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/pigeonsarproject.asp  

&gt;The pigeons were 93 percent accurate at locating objects floating at sea and their false positive rates were extremely low. Human flight crews were accurate 38 percent of the time. When combined with human searchers, the pigeons' success rate was nearly perfect.

&gt;Also, unlike humans, the pigeons did not get bored as Simmons had trained them to respond even when there were hours between sightings. Eventually, the Coast Guard recognized the value of Simmons' pigeons and called this project "the best daylight search system" yet developed. </Comment><Comment author="MasterLJ" date="1448071950.0" date_utc="1448043150.0" id="cx74gg5" parent_id="t1_cx71heh" type="reply">Machine Learning.  Initially, algorithms were created to mimic neurons and applied to "fuzzy" problems like "is this picture a bird or a national park?"  These systems occur in nature and are very good at what they do... so I'd imagine that it's not too far a leap to suggest using nature's own mechanisms over Machine Learning algorithms.

It's very interesting because Machine Learning has been applied towards these types of problems in the past, namely, identifying cancer.  I'm really not sure how successful they've been, but I can't imagine they had more success than the pigeons.</Comment><Comment author="congressman_horse" date="1448097974.0" date_utc="1448069174.0" id="cx7jtnt" parent_id="t1_cx74gg5" type="reply">It's an active area of research at some well-funded labs; I listened to a presentation at the NIH a few months ago on computer vision in cancer detection with fairly accurate results.

Most stipends increase with your education level, and if you're smart about how you spend your money, it can usually cover cost of living while there.  Some programs are summer-long, others vary depending on the program.  You get to work with renowned scientists on their research and see what goes into a government research facility like the NIH.  It's a pretty cool experience if you have the time and inclination.

Skinner, who tried to develop a pigeon-controlled guided bomb. The pigeons were trained to recognize a target and a clever arrangement of screens and sensors essentially allowed the pigeons to continuously steer the bomb towards the target. The concept was tried several times before the advent of modern electronic guidance systems.

Seriously, though, while "neat," this is vaguely ridiculous. They trained the pigeons to see microcalcifications which (usually) stand out like a sore thumb.

No hospital in its right mind would ever try having a bunch of pigeons in their path lab to make diagnoses, as this author seems to envision as the future.

Blood letting is still a therapy for people with [hereditary hemochromatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload), which is a condition where you take up too much iron from your food and then can't get rid of it, so it is deposited in all kinds of tissues and starts being a nuisance. (Yes, these are medical terms ;-) )Blood letting then is a way of getting rid of the excess iron. 

However, if you don't have that condition, the blood letting itself probably doesn't improve your health. A small effect could be that we do some tests on donors, so sometimes a donor is diagnosed with an early illness and can get treated better or earlier. (Had one of those cases myself, a few weeks ago, with a donor with a developing heart condition which could have become fatal, had I not noticed an irregular heart beat and sent her to the ER). Another is that blood donors might make healthier choices (they eat better, they exercise more) than people who aren't a blood donor. So being a donor is just a part of their healthier lifestyle. And finally, you can't be a donor if you're ill, so being a frequent donor might also be a selection bias causing healthier people to be in one of the research groups which then, surprise surprise, lives longer.

(Having read the news article now, they tried to correct for the fact that a frequent blood donor is healthier than a non-donor or an infrequent donor, but I'm not completely convinced that their correction was complete).

Still, the very good news is that apparently, donating is not bad for you :-) </Comment><Comment author="MasterFubar" date="1448133846.0" date_utc="1448105046.0" id="cx7vxnw" parent_id="t1_cx7srdv" type="reply">Your points about selection bias are important and they are sometimes ignored in scientific studies.

For another example, there's the matter of consuming alcohol. There are studies showing that consuming a small amount of alcohol is better than no intake at all, but that effect disappears once you take into account people who have quit drinking because they are alcoholics.

This is how selection bias works. Yes, people who donate blood have better health than people who cannot donate blood because of health problems. Yes, people who drink moderately have better health than former heavy drinkers who quit. 

The strong effect of some fringe cases may cause an effect in the total when outliers aren't properly handled.

This makes a lot of sense.

1. Women especially have problems with blood iron due to menstruation.

2. Depending on the type of donation, their requirements for iron could be rather high (double donation vs single).  They err on the side of caution, wanting you to have higher than normal iron so that you don't suffer any ill effects from donating.

3. Iron levels fluctuate for a variety of reasons.  I've done a *LOT* of donations, mostly all double-red cell donations.  Before one donation I was on a heavy weight-lifting routine which caused me to miss their iron targets which had *never* happened before (my muscles were using up the iron to build bigger muscles).

Except perhaps that it often feels a bit medical: nurses attending to you, medical questions being asked, a needle, a medical-looking machine which measures how much blood has been collected already (it weights the bag), etc. So perhaps even if you're donating in a blood "bus", your experience is a medical-like one. </Comment><Comment author="kangareagle" date="1448131237.0" date_utc="1448102437.0" id="cx7vedy" parent_id="t1_cx7t7x4" type="reply">The study wasn't in the US.

So I think you're right in that the selection bias is that "people who are healthy or more aware are the ones who donate".

I don't think anything at the blood donation center reinforces healthy habits, except for maybe the questionnaire.

First, my late father was O negative (universal donor, the most needed blood type because it's the only type you can give in an emergency trauma situation before you know someone's blood type). As a result, he was in constant demand with the Red Cross, and he had regularly scheduled donations as soon as he was allowed to donate. My sister was diagnosed with hemachromatosis (too much iron), which is genetic, and it turns out that it's not from my mother, so my father must have had hemochromatosis, but it was essentially treated and never diagnosed because of his routine donations. A very sweet story of a selfless act with an unknown benefit. On the other side of the coin, I worked for 7 years on a pediatric oncology / bone marrow transplant unit and gave more transfusions of blood and platelets than I could count back in the day, to really amazing, beautiful, incredible kids who would have died without them. So thank you to everyone who donates. It really matters. There are more shortages of blood than you think, so everyone should get out there and donate regularly. Even if it doesn't lengthen your life (as it surely did for my big-hearted father), it will lengthen someone else's. I wish I could show you pictures of some of those kids dragging their IV poles (that had blood transfusions and chemo going) behind them in dogged determination to get to the playroom... you'd see what a real difference it makes to give blood.

&gt;This is a precautionary measure that was implemented in 2004 against the possible risk of variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease (vCJD) being transmitted by blood from an infected donor to the patient. There is currently no way to test blood, so at the moment those who have had a transfusion after 1980 can't give blood.

Mad cow disease can take decades to show up, and can't  be tested for (mentioned above) so if you've received blood that *may* have CJD in it then you can't donate. Once enough time has passed for CJD to be wiped out they'll lift the ban.

Is is possible that dark matter doesn't exist and that there is something fundamental about regular matter we are missing?  That regular matter may contain the missing mass that we are detecting but not seeing?</Comment><Comment author="RoarMeister" date="1448098207.0" date_utc="1448069407.0" id="cx7jxqg" parent_id="t1_cx7esw9" type="reply">I'm no physicist but I enjoy reading [this guy's theory](http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/mihsc-101.html) as a different explanation. At the very least I agree with his assessment that dark matter seems like a patch job. Basically when we did our math we found that the equations didn't balance right because when we plug in the measured mass it equals galaxies flinging apart. So we added a variable, dark matter, to balance it and hold our galaxies together in our equations. This is the dominant theory mainly because theories are more popular when they add to the general consensus rather than challenge it. It could be true or it could be that were missing something in our theory such that when we plug in the observed mass (and no extra dark matter) it doesn't equal galaxies flinging apart. Only way to know is through more experiments and observations.</Comment><Comment author="i_dont_trust_the_VA" date="1448098382.0" date_utc="1448069582.0" id="cx7k0pz" parent_id="t1_cx7jxqg" type="reply">I find it interesting that they use dark matter as a place holder and we  have never found anything locally (on our planet) that exhibits the traits necessary to fill that void.

We have come up with a lot of theoretical particles but some are just harder to prove than others. We've proven some relatively recently with the Large Hadron Collider for instance. However the theoretical particles that explain dark matter don't really collide with normal matter so we can't really detect them except for gravitationally.

In fact I must also admit I myself didn't have a full understanding of all the evidence (I decided to do some reading after my post). One of the common ways we measured the mass of galaxies in the past was by observing how fast the outer stars were traveling (by seeing the doppler shift). This of course would only give us an accurate answer assuming our physics model is correct. However we've been using gravitational lensing now to observe the mass of galaxies and observations point to there being much more mass than we can explain from normal mass. So it actually does fit better to explain this mass as coming from a massive cloud of undiscovered particles.

Now I don't know exactly how accurate these measurements are but obviously if they are accurate and there is a greater observed mass through gravitational lensing than what we can see or expect then there must be some sort of "dark matter". At this point I must admit my knowledge isn't good enough to form a decent opinion anymore. But I am a natural skeptic. I'd like to see a study that actually goes into how well things add up between the mass measured by gravitational lensing vs actual observed/expected masses and if the measured mass by gravitational lensing leads to a stable galaxy like we observe. I'm sure there probably already are studies.</Comment><Comment author="CarthOSassy" date="1448102268.0" date_utc="1448073468.0" id="cx7luga" parent_id="t1_cx7k0pz" type="reply">Proposing hitherto unknown particles to fill gaps in a structure with more holes than substance, is exactly how chemistry was born - we had equations and rules that defined the structure of the periodic table of elements.

Its main characteristics are that it doesn't reflect light AND that we have no way of detecting it at the moment, so I guess we just don't know. 

I'm mot saying that it is impossible for dark matter to exist, but simply that in science it's important to remain unbiased, no matter how long we've been building upon concepts and how far we think we've developped them.

Our solar system has a ratio of about 99.5% solar mass to 0.5% planetary mass, but that doesn't include all the asteroids, kuper belt objects, comets, etc (which is still probably insignificant).

Sure. Gravitational lensing is a way to measure the mass of some region. Light bends around any object with mass. The more density, the more bending there is.

And doppler shift is a way to measure the rotation speeds of galaxies.

Irrelevant.

Milikan was off by a huge amount, but others came by and corrected his errors. That's how the system is designed to work.

You don't have to detect every little thing. We look at a big part of the sky and detect the overall mass. Based on our knowledge of how galaxies, stars, planets, etc. form, we can come to a really close conclusion.

Your issue isn't with dark matter. You just aren't sure everything else is correct. At that point, you just need to look into all of those questions yourself. All of those methods are open to read about.

Though I suppose if this type of matter lacked the subatomic particles responsible for E/M interaction, and suppose gravitons do exist, this matter could be composed of gravitons but not the other  subatomic particles... or something like that... which would be interesting.</Comment><Comment author="Cocoon_Of_Dust" date="1448092678.0" date_utc="1448063878.0" id="cx7h6c1" parent_id="t1_cx7ckea" type="reply">Considering what we know about dark matter, *any* explanation of it would be very interesting. :)  It's something totally new, unknown, and doesn't show up anywhere in our current physics models.</Comment><Comment author="thehighground" date="1448103058.0" date_utc="1448074258.0" id="cx7m7op" parent_id="t3_3tkon5" type="comment">What if all these other galaxies are just past or future versions of our own in different time lines?</Comment></Comments></Post><Post author="whatsupdoc10" date="1448063106.0" date_utc="1448034306.0" id="3tksuo" num_total_comments="18" num_true_comments="16" title="Move over moonshine, here comes sunshine: Nanoparticle process uses light to distil alcohol and produces up to 99% pure alcohol - more than conventional distillation can manage and more efficiently too" type="post">Move over moonshine, here comes sunshine: Nanoparticle process uses light to distil alcohol and produces up to 99% pure alcohol - more than conventional distillation can manage and more efficiently too : <Comments><Comment author="willandbeyond" date="1448069531.0" date_utc="1448040731.0" id="cx72uuv" parent_id="t3_3tksuo" type="comment">Peer reviewed research is [here](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02804).

They suggest kids with ADHD are more likely to have trouble making and maintaining friendships, which would be a reason for the general increase in bullying among those with ADHD.</Comment><Comment author="Bears54" date="1448139884.0" date_utc="1448111084.0" id="cx7xd8k" parent_id="t3_3torly" type="comment">I was always nice to the kid who sold me his adderall. </Comment><Comment author="GetCapeFly" date="1448142241.0" date_utc="1448113441.0" id="cx7y3o9" parent_id="t3_3torly" type="comment">Interesting.

It conforms to [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines).

As you might expect, the findings are rather commonsensical:
&gt;With the elimination of mandatory retirement, the average age of college and university faculty members has increased. While this has raised some concerns, relatively little research has tried to measure the impact of this aging on productivity inside the classroom. Using data from the RateMyProfessors.com website for a large sample of instructors in a broad cross-section of colleges and universities, we find that age does affect teaching effectiveness, at least as perceived by students. Age has a negative impact on student ratings of faculty members that is robust across genders, groups of academic disciplines and types of institutions. However, the effect does not begin until faculty members reach their mid-forties and does not seem to increase even when they reach the former retirement ages of 65 or 70. Moreover, the quantitative impact of age on student ratings is small and can be offset by other factors, especially the physical appearance of professors and how easy students consider them to be. When we restrict our sample to those professors deemed hot by student raters, the effect of age disappears completely. We conclude that ending mandatory retirement has had little impact on student perceptions of faculty quality.</Comment></Comments></Post></Subreddit>
